USAID partnered with APOPO to accelerate early TB detection using an unexpected but highly effective, HeroRATs, African pouched rats trained to detect TB-positive sputum samples through scent. As the Innovation Expert on the USAID side, I supported the initiative by mapping the operational ecosystem, identifying workflow gaps between laboratories, clinics, and APOPO facilities, and helping design scalable service processes that could be adopted by public health partners. The goal was to create a reliable, repeatable, and community-centered diagnostic service model capable of identifying more TB cases faster and at a fraction of traditional costs."

Over two intensive days, participants explored how sustainable consumption, reuse & recycling, and end-user co-creation can shape future-ready business models. My role was to design and facilitate high-impact sessions, guide multidisciplinary teams through structured decision-making, and ensure that each CEBM prototype was validated with experts from diverse industries\u2014including lighting, meat production, repair services, and energy. The result was a unified understanding of how circular design principles can translate into commercially viable, scalable, and environmentally responsible business strategies."

Under the umbrella of Kuudes and with a brief from the City of Helsinki, we set out to deeply understand how Arabic-speaking residents experience municipal services, uncover barriers, and highlight gaps where service delivery does not meet community expectations. The goal: to build a foundation for more inclusive, accessible public services across the city of Helsinki."

Traditional monitoring systems couldn\u2019t keep up with the scale of the problem. Gallinazo Avisa (\u201cVultures Warn\u201d) took an unconventional path: equipping rescued black vultures with GPS trackers and GoPro cameras so they could help locate hidden garbage hotspots from the sky and feed that data into a live, public map. As the Innovation Expert on the USAID side, I worked at the intersection of technology, environment, and public engagement: shaping how vulture-generated data would be translated into actionable insights for authorities, and how the story would be told so that residents didn\u2019t just watch vultures fly, they understood the problem and felt invited to act."

This project combined macro-level ecosystem mapping with micro-level field research in Jaipur, Odisha, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand to understand the drivers and barriers of digital payment adoption among merchants and consumers, particularly focusing on women, rural communities, and low-income populations."

As Lead Service Designer, I supported the strategy by grounding sustainability ambitions in real human behavior. My work focused on research, insights, personas, and scenarios connecting customer expectations, employee realities, and operational constraints so the final strategy could move beyond targets and reports into everyday decision-making at scale."

I worked as an Innovation Expert and Digital Transformation Lead, shaping the service, processes, and adoption model that enabled more than 100 missions to move away from paper while remaining audit-ready, compliant, and operationally efficient. The work balanced strict federal governance with the realities of day-to-day work in diverse global contexts."

As Lead Service Designer, I assisted in shaping an NDA-safe commercialization narrative and service structure: clarifying who the offering is for, what problems it solves, and how a research organization can package deep-tech capabilities into actionable services, without overpromising, and without forcing a one-size-fits-all sales story."

In partnership with the Finnish Court Administration (Tuomioistuinlaitos), our multidisciplinary team set out to deeply understand the lived experience of witnesses and design tools that would bring clarity, predictability, and emotional support into a traditionally rigid system. The project began as a research exploration and culminated in a real, implemented public-facing solution now used nationwide."
