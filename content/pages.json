      "Overview",
      "Tuberculosis remains one of the world\u2019s deadliest infectious diseases, especially in low-resource settings where diagnostic capacity is limited. USAID partnered with APOPO to accelerate early TB detection using an unexpected but highly effective, HeroRATs, African pouched rats trained to detect TB-positive sputum samples through scent. As the Innovation Expert on the USAID side, I supported the initiative by mapping the operational ecosystem, identifying workflow gaps between laboratories, clinics, and APOPO facilities, and helping design scalable service processes that could be adopted by public health partners. The goal was to create a reliable, repeatable, and community-centered diagnostic service model capable of identifying more TB cases faster and at a fraction of traditional costs.",
      "Understanding the Detection Bottleneck",
      "Microscopy, the primary diagnostic tool in many clinics, misses a significant number of TB-positive cases, especially when patients have low bacterial loads. Clinics in Tanzania and Mozambique faced overwhelmed labs, limited staff, and slow turnaround times, leading to delayed treatment and continued community spread. My role involved analyzing the end-to-end diagnostic journey, identifying where cases were lost, and designing a service blueprint that integrated HeroRAT screening into existing health systems with minimal disruption while maximizing detection yield.",
      "Designing for Scale",
      "To scale the program, we needed more than rats; we needed a service system. I facilitated co-creation sessions with APOPO trainers, clinicians, and USAID\u2019s health and M&E teams to define the standardized sample transfer flows, better understand the quality assurance protocols, and try to make sense of the unified reporting mechanism for clinics, aiming to create a predictable daily screening rhythm utilizing HeroRAT capacity. These design interventions strengthened the reliability of rat-based TB detection and gave clinics confidence in adopting the innovation.",
      "Building Trust in an Unconventional Solution",
      "Introducing an unconventional diagnostic tool required sensitivity and strong communication. Many clinicians were skeptical about using rats for medical screening. I worked with USAID communications and APOPO\u2019s outreach team to develop evidence-based narratives, visual explanations, and field demonstrations that emphasized scientific rigor, accuracy rates, and speed. This human-centered approach helped shift perceptions, increasing adoption and fostering collaboration across clinics.",
      "Impact",
      "The redesigned diagnostic workflow enabled HeroRATs to screen hundreds of samples per day, reducing detection time from days to minutes. Clinics using the service reported up to 45% more TB-positive cases identified than through microscopy alone, ensuring that previously undiagnosed patients received timely treatment. This service design effort strengthened USAID\u2019s ability to scale the innovation across partner clinics and contributed to a more resilient TB-detection ecosystem.",

      "Reflection",
      "Working on this project was one of the most meaningful chapters in my career. Being on the USAID side allowed me to collaborate with people from Tanzania, Mozambique, Belgium, and the United States, each with different perspectives, realities, and hopes for what better healthcare could look like. Bringing all these voices together wasn\u2019t always easy, but it taught me what true co-creation feels like in environments where every decision can change someone\u2019s life. Introducing the idea of using rats for medical diagnostics was, honestly, a challenge. It was unconventional, unfamiliar, and at times difficult for stakeholders to imagine. I spent months pitching an idea that sounded \u201ctoo different\u201d and sometimes even \u201ctoo strange\u201d to be taken seriously. But once we shifted our communication strategy, listened deeply to each audience, and shaped the story around their concerns, the doors that once felt closed began to open. That experience taught me that innovations don\u2019t fail because they lack value; they fail because the story around them doesn\u2019t meet people where they are. Receiving a U.S. Government Award for this work was an honour, but the real reward was witnessing communities trust this solution and seeing patients get diagnosed sooner because of it. This project reminded me why I chose service design: to connect unlikely ideas, unlikely partners, and unlikely solutions and help them become real, human, and impactful.",

      "The Innovation Camp brought together global circular economy professionals to test and strengthen the Circular Economy Business Model (CEBM). Over two intensive days, participants explored how sustainable consumption, reuse & recycling, and end-user co-creation can shape future-ready business models. My role was to design and facilitate high-impact sessions, guide multidisciplinary teams through structured decision-making, and ensure that each CEBM prototype was validated with experts from diverse industries\u2014including lighting, meat production, repair services, and energy. The result was a unified understanding of how circular design principles can translate into commercially viable, scalable, and environmentally responsible business strategies.",
      "Understanding Circular Challenges Through Collective Insight",
      "The camp began with defining what circular value means across industries. Through interviews, pre-work exercises, and co-analysis, we aligned participants around the three pillars of CEBM: sustainable consumption, reuse & recycling, and end-user co-creation. My focus was on leading the Sustainable Consumption stream\u2014guiding participants to uncover systemic gaps, behavioural barriers, and market opportunities. This foundation ensured that every prototype aligned with both environmental goals and real business constraints.",
      "Bringing Together Global Perspectives",
      "With over 200 professionals from multiple countries, alignment was critical. I facilitated sessions that helped participants quickly build trust, understand cultural nuances, and navigate differences in sustainability maturity levels. We used Howspace, Miro, and Zoom to structure group thinking, validate assumptions, and ensure inclusive participation. Despite distance and time-zone challenges, we created a seamless, psychologically safe environment where experts openly shared challenges and perspectives. This alignment enabled the group to move from abstract circular concepts to practical, testable business model prototypes.",
      "Turning Circular Principles into Real Solutions",
      "Five business model prototypes were developed and tested with industry experts. I led two key sessions, one for the lighting industry and one for the meat production industry, where we explored how circularity could reshape their operations. Using structured voting, rapid prototyping tools, and guided discussions, we validated: 1-Market desirability 2-Technical feasibility 3-Circular impact 4-Business viability The facilitation hierarchy, pre-designed materials, and clear instructions ensured smooth execution, even with large groups. By the end of day two, each prototype had a refined value proposition, tested assumptions, and a clear pathway for further development.",

      "// Real-time sketching during the workshop, used to synthesise complex discussions into clear, shared insights for the group. //",
      "Reflection",
      "Working with sustainability and circular economy experts revealed a universal truth: circular transformation is not just a technical shift \u2014 it is behavioural, cultural, and deeply human. The camp made it clear how differently participants defined \u201ccircular value\u201d depending on their industry, culture, or background. For some, it meant material reuse. For others, it meant behavioural change, long-term design commitment, or community involvement. The value of the camp came from creating a space where these interpretations could coexist \u2014 and then be aligned into a shared definition. Visual facilitation also played a critical role. Having a skilled illustrator capturing insights in real time helped participants see complexity become clarity. It allowed the group to track emerging patterns, reduce abstraction, and build a shared mental model \u2014 something especially important when participants come from technical or scientific fields. Another key learning was the importance of bringing business leaders into the same room early, aligning their expectations, and making trade-offs transparent. Circularity touches supply chains, investment models, and long-term risk planning \u2014 none of which can move forward unless leadership alignment is strong and explicit. From a facilitation standpoint, the workshop highlighted how essential a well-designed playbook is for large-scale events. Clear roles, escalation paths, timing rules, and communication scripts ensured the experience remained smooth despite cultural differences, multiple time zones, and highly technical discussions. Without this backbone, the complexity would have overwhelmed the process. If repeating this project, I would expand the pre-work exercises to deepen alignment before sessions begin \u2014 especially considering the diverse mix of expertise. More importantly, I would integrate early diagnostic surveys to surface assumptions and misconceptions before participants arrive, accelerating convergence in the live sessions. Overall, this project reinforced the importance of structure, psychological safety, and visual thinking in tackling complex sustainability challenges. It strengthened my ability to guide large-scale co-creation, translate circular models into practical actions, and support global teams as they work toward a more regenerative, resilient future.",

      "Overview",
      "Helsinki is one of Europe\u2019s fastest-diversifying cities. Yet many residents, especially immigrants and non-native speakers, struggle to access or fully understand public services. Under the umbrella of Kuudes and with a brief from the City of Helsinki, we set out to deeply understand how Arabic-speaking residents experience municipal services, uncover barriers, and highlight gaps where service delivery does not meet community expectations. The goal: to build a foundation for more inclusive, accessible public services across the city of Helsinki.",
      "Understanding Lived Realities",
      "My role focused on generating deep insights from Arabic-speaking communities, one of Helsinki\u2019s largest and most diverse immigrant groups. Through semi-structured group interviews and group discussions, which were conducted online, I built trust, encouraged honest storytelling, and explored how people navigate social, health, education, and employment services. Each conversation revealed the gap between intended service design and lived experience, highlighting barriers rooted in language, expectations, cultural norms, and system complexity.",
      "Building Trust & Participation",
      "Because technology, timing, and unfamiliarity with public institutions often prevent meaningful participation, I personally contacted each participant beforehand. These conversations built rapport, explained expectations, and reduced anxiety around joining an online interview. On the day of the session, every participant arrived on time, an outcome that speaks to the importance of relational groundwork in multicultural research. Safe space led to deeper insights, richer dialogue, and more meaningful contributions.",
      "Mapping Experiences, Emotions & Needs",
      "The interviews revealed consistent gaps: limited clarity about available services, confusion when navigating bureaucracy, and cultural mismatches between residents\u2019 expectations and the ways services are delivered. We synthesized insights into themes linked to communication, trust, accessibility, and cultural context. These findings became critical evidence for the City of Helsinki, showing where services unintentionally exclude or overwhelm specific communities. This work did not just collect stories; it created a clearer understanding of how residents actually experience city services.",
      "Impact",
      "This project gave the City of Helsinki a clearer understanding of how Arabic-speaking residents experience public services, revealing gaps that were previously invisible inside the system. The insights directly informed the city\u2019s broader work on social sustainability, accessibility, and inclusive service development. For the first time, cultural expectations, emotional barriers, and practical challenges were captured in a structured, evidence-based format that city teams can use for future decision making. This work became a reference point for future multicultural research and strengthened Helsinki\u2019s ability to design services that truly reflect its diverse population.",

      "// As the project was deep research based and to comply with GDPR all pictures all for visual purposes //",
      "Reflection",
      "Working closely with immigrant communities reaffirmed one of the biggest truths in public service design: services don\u2019t fail because people are difficult\u2014they fail when systems aren\u2019t built with people\u2019s lived realities in mind. One powerful insight from this project was how differently the word \u201cassist\u201d is understood across cultures. For some, assistance means guidance and clear instructions. For others, it implies emotional reassurance, hands-on support, or even advocacy. These interpretations shift based on a person\u2019s upbringing, education, cultural norms, and past experiences with institutions. When a system defines assistance one way, but a community understands it another way, friction is inevitable. If repeating this project, I would push for even broader community participation across more neighborhoods, and deeper collaboration with city employees themselves. The gap between resident expectations and institutional structures is still significant\u2014and closing it requires cultural competence, empathy, and a higher level of design maturity within public systems. This project strengthened Helsinki\u2019s ability to create services that reflect the people who live here, not just the structures that manage them. And that is the true foundation of inclusive public service design.",

      "Overview",
      "BMI Group, one of the world\u2019s largest roofing manufacturers, operated on systems that no longer reflected real work practices across its global markets. Employees relied heavily on manual workarounds and informal tools that existed outside official systems, creating inconsistency, inefficiency, and knowledge gaps. My role as Senior Service Designer was to uncover these hidden behaviors, align global teams around a unified workflow vision, and design the foundation for a new digital platform that supports real-world operations\u2014not just idealized processes.",
      "Discover",
      "We began by conducting ethnographic research, contextual interviews, and workflow shadowing across multiple countries. This revealed disconnects between documented processes and the lived experiences of employees. Much of the core work happened \u201coutside the system\u201d in spreadsheets, emails, WhatsApp messages, and personal notes. These insights formed a clear starting point: BMI\u2019s tools did not reflect how people actually work and transformation had to begin with understanding that truth.",
      "Align",
      "I designed and facilitated a series of co-creation workshops that brought together teams from multiple markets, each with its own ways of working, cultures, and operational histories. In these sessions, we openly surfaced and mapped local workarounds, uncovered universal pain points, and revealed systemic bottlenecks created by outdated tools and fragmented processes. As the discussions deepened, teams were able to prioritize the most critical challenges for redesign, often realizing for the first time how similar their struggles were, despite being spread across different regions. A major turning point was when the group collaboratively built their first unified customer journey map, creating shared visibility into how employees and customers experience the service end-to-end. For many participants, this was the first moment where a collective picture of the organization\u2019s challenges truly emerged, forming a strong foundation for alignment and future transformation.",
      "DESIGN",
      "Using insights gathered during discovery and alignment, we ideated user-centered solutions and translated them into a high-fidelity prototype for a new platform. This prototype reflected real workflows, integrated user priorities, and aligned business requirements with operational realities. Through iterative testing and refinement, we progressively validated and improved the experience directly with employees.",
      "IMPACT",
      "The project delivered BMI a clear and actionable roadmap for digital transformation\u2014one grounded in genuine user behaviour rather than organisational assumptions. The high-fidelity prototype became the company\u2019s first unified vision of a future platform that reflects real workflows, operational constraints, and strategic business goals. The work did not stop at design. The validated prototype and service blueprint were handed over to the development teams as a foundation for implementation, ensuring continuity from concept to execution. The project also expanded into change management and training readiness, preparing teams across multiple markets to adopt the new ways of working. This marked a decisive shift from fragmented, manual processes toward a coherent, scalable, and human-centred digital ecosystem built for long-term growth.",

      "Reflection",
      "Leading this project reinforced an essential truth: technology succeeds only when it aligns with real human behavior. BMI\u2019s employees were highly skilled, yet forced to rely on outdated tools and improvised systems. Our work revealed not only operational pain points but also cultural and communication gaps between markets. What made the difference was creating a shared space where diverse teams\u2014from factory floors to commercial offices\u2014could map their realities, challenge assumptions, and co-create solutions. As a lead designer, my role was to translate these human insights into a strategic direction that the business could confidently invest in. The biggest learning? Modernization is not just about introducing a new platform\u2014it\u2019s about creating the conditions for people to let go of old habits and adopt better ones. This project strengthened my belief that service design is most powerful when it brings clarity, empathy, and alignment to complex organizational environments. It is worth to mentioning all visuals shown are conceptual or anonymized representations used for demonstration purposes. They do not display BMI\u2019s actual internal systems or confidential data.",

      "Overview",
      "Lima produces thousands of tons of waste every day, and a significant share ends up in illegal dumps along rivers, roadsides, and informal areas, far from official landfills. Traditional monitoring systems couldn\u2019t keep up with the scale of the problem. Gallinazo Avisa (\u201cVultures Warn\u201d) took an unconventional path: equipping rescued black vultures with GPS trackers and GoPro cameras so they could help locate hidden garbage hotspots from the sky and feed that data into a live, public map. As the Innovation Expert on the USAID side, I worked at the intersection of technology, environment, and public engagement: shaping how vulture-generated data would be translated into actionable insights for authorities, and how the story would be told so that residents didn\u2019t just watch vultures fly, they understood the problem and felt invited to act.",
      "Seeing What the City Couldn\u2019t",
      "Lima has only a handful of official landfills for nearly 10 million residents; the rest of the city\u2019s waste often leaks into informal dumping sites that are hard to track from the ground. Vultures, however, naturally seek out decaying waste. Instead of fighting this behaviour, Gallinazo Avisa turned it into an environmental asset: by fitting selected birds with lightweight GPS units and GoPro cameras, their flight paths and footage could reveal where illegal dumps were concentrated. My role involved mapping the end-to-end service flow, from vulture flight and data capture, to GPS and video stream ingestion, to visualizing dumps on a live map, to coordinate municipal response. The design challenge was to make this system reliable enough for authorities to act on, while still being intuitive and engaging for the public.",
      "From Raw Flight Data to Actionable Maps",
      "Vultures generate messy, continuous movement data. What city officials and citizens needed, instead, were clear signals: \u201cHere is a likely dump site. Here is where to act.\u201d Working with environmental authorities, data specialists, and the creative team, I helped design: 1- Data rules for identifying potential dumping hotspots based on flight patterns and recorded footage. 2-A public-facing map where these hotspots could be visualized in near real time. To mix them together and create a simple feedback loop linking citizen reports and vulture data, so both could reinforce each other. Instead of just broadcasting a message, we co-created a service ecosystem: vultures scan, systems map, authorities act, and residents participate.",
      "Storytelling for a Strange but Powerful Idea",
      "Pitching this concept was not easy. On paper, \u201cwe\u2019re using vultures with cameras to fight garbage\u201d sounded too unconventional, even humorous, for many stakeholders. Some worried it would undermine the seriousness of the waste problem; others were unsure people would engage with birds as \u201cpartners.\u201d Together with the communications team and local partners, I worked on humanizing the story: 1- Giving each vulture a name and personality, 2- Framing them as \u201cdark superheroes\u201d helping the city, and grounding all messaging in real health and environmental stakes, not just spectacle. By tailoring how we communicated to different audiences, government leaders, local communities, youth, and media, we turned initial skepticism into curiosity, and curiosity into participation. Within weeks, the project had tens of thousands of interactions online and strong public recognition. And of course, data speaks louder than anything else at the end.",
      "Impact",
      "Gallinazo Avisa showed how nature, technology, and people can work together to tackle urban waste. Vultures equipped with GPS and cameras helped identify clusters of illegal dumps, feeding data into a live map that supported authorities\u2019 decisions on where to intervene first. At the same time, the project sparked broad public engagement. Residents followed the vultures online, learned about the scale of the waste problem, and contributed their own reports of polluted sites. This blend of environmental sensing and civic participation created a new kind of environmental service: one that made the invisible visible, and turned a stigmatized bird into a symbol of collective responsibility.",

      "Reflection",
      "Working on Gallinazo Avisa taught me how powerful unconventional innovation becomes when it is paired with the right story, the right communication approach, and a service system that truly respects the people it is meant to serve. I collaborated with incredible individuals from Peru, the United States, environmental NGOs, data scientists, and creative agencies, each bringing their own cultural rhythms, design languages, and expectations. The project became a living example of how diverse teams can create something none of us could have built alone. Convincing stakeholders to take seriously the idea of using vultures equipped with GoPro cameras and GPS trackers was one of the most challenging phases of my career. At first, many people laughed, hesitated, or dismissed the concept as too strange to be a real environmental solution. But by deeply understanding each audience, their fears, motivations, pride, and frustrations, we reframed the narrative from \u201cvultures with cameras\u201d to \u201ca new way to see what the city cannot.\u201d That shift changed everything. Once people understood the purpose, not just the technology, they leaned in. Authorities began to trust the data. Citizens began to participate. The city began to see itself from above. For this work, I received an award from the American government, a recognition that meant a great deal to me, because it affirmed that bold ideas, when handled with empathy and cultural sensitivity, can become powerful tools for public good.",

      "Overview",
      "Between 2014 and 2018, India embarked on one of the world's most ambitious financial inclusion initiatives, bringing over 330 million people into the formal financial sector. As part of USAID's commitment to support India's digital financial inclusion agenda, I contributed to comprehensive research examining how digital payments could catalyze meaningful financial inclusion for underserved populations across urban and rural India. This project combined macro-level ecosystem mapping with micro-level field research in Jaipur, Odisha, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand to understand the drivers and barriers of digital payment adoption among merchants and consumers, particularly focusing on women, rural communities, and low-income populations.",
      "CONTEXT & CHALLENGE",
      "India has seen unprecedented growth in bank account ownership through the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). However, access did not translate into active use, 48% of account holders made no deposits or withdrawals, revealing a critical gap between financial inclusion on paper and meaningful engagement in practice. The core challenge was not account penetration, but driving sustained usage of digital financial services. The research set out to understand why digital payments were not scaling at the same pace as bank accounts, what would motivate merchants and customers to shift from cash to digital, and how digital payments could function as an effective on-ramp to deeper financial inclusion, rather than a standalone intervention. To address these questions, the work focused on two distinct but interconnected environments. In urban Jaipur, the CATALYST program tested ecosystem-level approaches with 7,500 individuals and 1,000 merchants, examining adoption dynamics across consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and service providers. In parallel, rural interventions applied value chain\u2013based approaches in dairy (Odisha), food and beverage (Maharashtra), and poultry (Jharkhand), exploring how digital payments could be embedded into everyday economic activity across agricultural and informal markets. Together, these contexts allowed the team to examine both system-level constraints and ground-level behaviors, bridging policy ambition with lived financial realities.",
      "INSIGHTS",
      "Despite rapid technological advancement, the program demonstrated that human interaction remains critical at the last mile. Building trust and capability among first-time digital finance users required intensive, hands-on support. For example, onboarding just 101 new account holders required five field staff working for approximately 30 days, highlighting that scaling technology does not eliminate the need for human facilitation. Adoption of digital finance was also closely linked to aspiration and identity. For many users, particularly younger participants, using digital payments symbolized belonging to \u201cDigital Bharat\u201d and aligning with a modern, forward-looking vision of India. Digital finance was not only a functional tool but a marker of social and economic progress. The work further revealed that product design is a major, yet often underestimated, barrier to inclusion. Most digital finance applications were built for urban, affluent, English-speaking users, unintentionally excluding large segments of the population. Products were frequently data-intensive, overly complex, and lacked meaningful multi-language or low-literacy support. At the same time, cash remained highly resilient. Strong status quo bias persisted, with 55% of non-adopting merchants citing lack of customer demand as the primary reason for not accepting digital payments. For many users, cash continued to represent security, trust, liquidity, and simplicity, values that digital alternatives had not yet fully replaced. Finally, the program challenged the assumption that digital payments automatically lead to financial inclusion. Digitizing merchant transactions alone did not result in poverty reduction or deeper financial resilience unless accompanied by broader ecosystem interventions, including financial literacy, relevant product design, trust-building, and supportive policy frameworks.",
      "APPROACH",
      "The work combined urban experimentation, rural value chain pilots, and macro-level ecosystem analysis to understand and unlock scalable pathways for inclusive digital payments adoption. Within the Urban CATALYST Program in Jaipur, along with my team, we conducted a comprehensive mapping of the digital payments ecosystem, identifying key stakeholders, infrastructure gaps, and high-potential opportunity areas. This was complemented by deep ethnographic research in low-income neighborhoods such as Bhatta Basti, providing insight into everyday financial behaviors and trust dynamics. The program partnered with five fintech incubators to pilot and refine last-mile payment solutions, while simultaneously digitizing pharmaceutical and dairy supply chains to embed digital payments into routine commercial activity. Over a 20-month period, we provided intensive, hands-on merchant support, including onboarding, training, and troubleshooting, to ensure sustained adoption rather than short-term uptake. In parallel, rural value chain pilots focused on sectors with high female participation, including dairy, food and beverage, and poultry. We worked directly with stakeholders like farmers, merchants, and aggregators to digitize B2B transactions and integrate digital payments into existing trading relationships. These pilots examined gender dynamics and financial empowerment outcomes while testing adoption patterns across different farmer profiles, from subsistence-based producers to more aspirational, growth-oriented actors. At the macro ecosystem level, the work included extensive stakeholder interviews with senior government officials, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) representatives, fintech leaders, and development-sector experts. This qualitative insight was combined with analysis of national-level data on UPI growth, payment bank performance, and account dormancy. The team also mapped the broader policy landscape, including Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar, Direct Benefit Transfers, and the long-term impacts of demonetization, to understand how regulation, infrastructure, and policy incentives shaped adoption on the ground.",
      "IMPACT",
      "The research culminated in a comprehensive Journey Map Report, published by USAID/mSTAR, which has since informed policy dialogue and private-sector strategy across India\u2019s digital financial services ecosystem. The work provided a rare, end-to-end view of how digital finance evolved between 2014 and 2018, linking national policy ambitions with lived user experiences on the ground. Key Deliverables included a 54-page Journey Map Report documenting India\u2019s digital financial services journey, alongside evidence-based recommendations tailored for the Government of India, private-sector actors, and development partners. Additional outputs comprised technical reports on fintech incubator programs, supply chain digitization, and gender dynamics, as well as learning notes capturing insights on merchant behavior, credit linkages, and mechanisms for driving sustained behavior change. The work translated into clear strategic recommendations across stakeholder groups. For the government, recommendations focused on clarifying Aadhaar-related regulations, embedding a stronger gender lens into the continuation of PMJDY, and investing in shared digital infrastructure to reduce fragmentation. For the private sector, the research emphasized the need to simplify application design and user experience, innovate around relevant savings products, and develop targeted strategies for engaging youth and first-time digital users. For the development sector, guidance centered on supporting inclusive business models through patient capital and strengthening the evidence base on how digital financial services contribute to poverty reduction and economic resilience. Overall, the research demonstrated that meaningful financial inclusion requires a shift from access to active usage. Digital payments alone are not sufficient; they must be embedded within broader, human-centered ecosystems that respond to diverse user needs, literacy levels, trust dynamics, and aspirations in order to deliver lasting inclusion and impact.",

      "Reflection",
      "This work reinforced a critical insight: technology alone does not drive inclusion. Sustainable impact emerges at the intersection of context, culture, trust, and human-centered design. Working across both urban and rural India highlighted the importance of designing for complexity rather than assuming uniform solutions. One of the clearest learnings was that one size never fits all. The realities, incentives, and constraints faced by urban merchants in Jaipur differed fundamentally from those of rural dairy farmers in Odisha, requiring distinct approaches to adoption, onboarding, and value creation. The research also underscored that gender and financial inclusion are deeply intersectional. Women\u2019s access to and use of digital finance was shaped not only by gender, but by household power dynamics, social networks, literacy levels, and access to technology, making simplistic \u201cwomen-focused\u201d solutions insufficient. Another key insight was the role of aspiration. Adoption of digital financial services was driven as much by identity and belonging as by functional utility. For many users, engaging with digital finance represented participation in a broader vision of a modern, forward-looking India. Finally, the experience emphasized that evidence must guide investment decisions. For the development sector in particular, rigorous research linking digital financial services to measurable poverty reduction and resilience outcomes is essential to justify scale, funding, and policy prioritization. Collectively, this experience shaped my approach to designing and leading work in complex, multi-stakeholder systems, where behavioral change, infrastructure, product design, and policy frameworks must align to create inclusive, scalable, and sustainable impact.",

      "Overview",
      "SOK Mara leads retail operations for S Group, Finland\u2019s largest cooperative retailer, serving nearly 80% of Finnish households through brands such as Prisma, S-market, and Sale. In 2023, SOK updated its sustainability strategy to translate ambitious climate and responsibility commitments into concrete actions across stores, supply chains, and customer experiences. As Lead Service Designer, I supported the strategy by grounding sustainability ambitions in real human behavior. My work focused on research, insights, personas, and scenarios connecting customer expectations, employee realities, and operational constraints so the final strategy could move beyond targets and reports into everyday decision-making at scale.",
      "Context & Challenge",
      "By 2023, S Group had already made bold sustainability commitments: carbon negativity by 2025, a 90% emissions reduction by 2030, and a fundamental shift toward sustainable food systems. The challenge was no longer ambition; it was execution across nearly 2,000 outlets, thousands of employees, and millions of customers with diverse needs and price sensitivities. Retail sustainability sits at the intersection of operations, customer choice, and supply chains. Energy crises, inflation, and evolving EU regulation (CSRD, ESRS) added pressure to ensure that sustainability decisions remained commercially viable, credible, and understandable to customers. The strategy update needed to align climate goals, food systems, circular economy initiatives, and biodiversity into a coherent direction while making sustainability feel natural, affordable, and trustworthy in everyday shopping moments.",
      "Design Approach",
      "My role was to bring a service design lens into the sustainability strategy process. I led and supported qualitative research, synthesizing insights from customers, store-level realities, and internal stakeholders to understand expectations, tensions, and decision drivers around sustainable consumption. I developed personas and future-facing scenarios that reflected real customer mindsets from price-conscious families to sustainability-driven consumers and operational perspectives from retail staff. These artifacts helped align stakeholders on who the strategy was really for and how sustainability choices would play out in practice. The insights and scenarios were then handed over to sustainability consultants to shape the strategic narrative. This ensured the final strategy was not only scientifically robust and policy-aligned, but also grounded in lived experience and behavioral realism.",
      "Strategy Integration",
      "The resulting strategy embedded sustainability directly into S Group\u2019s retail operating model. Climate action focused on renewable energy leadership, energy efficiency, and value chain emissions reduction, while food systems strategy centered on nudging customers toward plant-based, affordable, and locally produced choices. Rather than restricting choice, the strategy emphasized visibility, affordability, and convenience, making sustainable options easier to choose without moralizing or excluding customers. Loyalty data, in-store communication, pricing campaigns, and merchandising all became tools for behavior change. From a systems perspective, sustainability was aligned across governance, procurement standards, store design, and brand communication, allowing local cooperatives to adapt initiatives while maintaining a shared national direction.",
      "Impact",
      "The 2023 sustainability strategy supported S Group in achieving and accelerating several targets ahead of schedule, while strengthening customer trust and brand leadership in responsible retail. Sustainability became a core driver of operational decisions, customer experience design, and long-term value creation. By grounding the strategy in human-centered insights, SOK Mara ensured sustainability was not treated as a reporting exercise, but as a lived part of everyday retail, from energy use and packaging to food choices and loyalty engagement.",

      "Reflection",
      "This project reinforced my belief that sustainability only scales when it is designed around real human behavior. Working with SOK Mara showed how powerful service design can be in bridging climate science, business strategy, and everyday choices\u2014especially in environments as complex and visible as national retail. As Lead Service Designer, my contribution was not to write the strategy, but to make it believable and usable: aligning expectations through research, personas, and scenarios, and ensuring sustainability narratives reflected real life. This experience continues to shape how I approach sustainability, strategy, and systems design focusing on frictionless adoption, trust, and long-term impact rather than ambition alone.",

      "Overview",
      "ASIST (Agency Secure Image and Storage Tracking) is USAID\u2019s official electronic records system for managing AOR and COR award files across missions worldwide. Mandated as the sole system of record, ASIST marked a fundamental shift from fragmented, paper-heavy practices to standardized, digital-first recordkeeping aligned with federal records law. I worked as an Innovation Expert and Digital Transformation Lead, shaping the service, processes, and adoption model that enabled more than 100 missions to move away from paper while remaining audit-ready, compliant, and operationally efficient. The work balanced strict federal governance with the realities of day-to-day work in diverse global contexts.",
      "Context & Challenge",
      "Before ASIST, USAID\u2019s AOR/COR records were managed through a patchwork of local paper files, shared drives, and informal practices. Documents were stored in filing cabinets across missions, making retrieval slow, audits resource-intensive, and compliance inconsistent. Hybrid paper-digital files were common, increasing risk and rework. At the same time, federal pressure was increasing. Records legislation and government-wide \u201cdigital by default\u201d mandates required agencies to manage official records electronically, end hybrid filing, and improve auditability. For USAID, operating in more than 80 countries, this was not just a technology challenge\u2014it was an operating model and behavior change challenge. ASIST was positioned as the official, mandatory repository for AOR/COR records. Only documents filed in ASIST would be treated as the official record, forcing a decisive move away from paper and informal storage toward standardized, agency-wide practices.",
      "Design Approach",
      "My role focused on translating complex federal records requirements into workflows that AORs and CORs could realistically follow. I led and co-led discovery with missions to understand how paper files were actually created, maintained, and used, and where compliance and usability broke down. Using service design methods, I helped shape end-to-end workflows for award file creation, maintenance, and close-out. This included defining standardized folder structures, metadata, and naming conventions, and clear user journeys that aligned with real work rather than abstract policy. Equally important was enablement. I co-created training materials, coaching approaches, and practical guidance that made ASIST usable, not just mandatory. The goal was behavior change at scale: helping people understand not only what to do, but why it mattered for audits, continuity, and decision-making.",
      "Implementation at Scale",
      "ASIST was rolled out globally with automated folder creation, and notifications triggered when AORs and CORs were designated in USAID\u2019s procurement system. This reduced manual setup and reinforced consistent practices from day one. As the system became embedded, day-to-day work changed. Records could be accessed securely from anywhere, audits could be conducted remotely, and central oversight teams no longer depended on physical file retrieval. Paper storage rooms and ad-hoc filing practices gradually disappeared. Crucially, ASIST was not implemented as a standalone IT system. It was integrated into governance, training requirements, and authorization to perform award administration, making digital recordkeeping part of how work was done, not an optional add-on.",
      "Impact",
      "The ASIST transformation contributed to USAID\u2019s shift toward a majority-digital records profile, with roughly two-thirds of agency records fully digital by 2022. Missions reduced reliance on physical storage, improved document retrieval times, and strengthened audit readiness across portfolios. By standardizing workflows and enforcing a single system of record, USAID reduced compliance risk, improved consistency in AOR/COR files, and aligned operations with federal electronic records mandates\u2014while freeing up physical space and staff time previously tied to paper.",

      "Reflection",
      "This project was as much about people and culture as it was about systems and policy. I worked across multiple countries and missions, meeting teams where paper-based workarounds had evolved out of necessity, not resistance. Every location had its own constraints connectivity, staffing models, risk tolerance, local habits and ASIST only worked when those realities were acknowledged and designed for. I spent significant time traveling, listening, running trainings, adjusting workflows, and co-creating practical tweaks that respected both federal compliance and human behavior. That meant aligning legal requirements, technology limitations, and cultural differences often mediating between policy owners, IT teams, auditors, and frontline staff. Designing compliance, in this context, meant making the right thing also the easy thing. Seeing missions successfully adopt a digital-first way of working and ultimately being recognized with an award for the impact of this work made the complexity worthwhile. It reinforced my belief that large-scale digital transformation succeeds when service design bridges governance, trust, and real work on the ground.",

As Lead Service Designer, I assisted in shaping an NDA-safe commercialization narrative and service structure: clarifying who the offering is for, what problems it solves, and how a research organization can package deep-tech capabilities into actionable services, without overpromising, and without forcing a one-size-fits-all sales story.",
      "Context & Opportunity",
      "In 2022, mycelium leather sat at a market inflection point: brands and manufacturers were hungry for credible alternatives to animal leather and fossil-based synthetics, but the ecosystem was still early, fragmented, and full of scalability and consistency challenges. For many players, the bottleneck wasn\u2019t interest it was reliable production, repeatable quality, and a clear path from prototype to product. VTT\u2019s strength was uniquely positioned for this moment: multidisciplinary expertise, pilot infrastructure, and a \u201cbeyond the obvious\u201d role as a neutral, trusted R&D institution able to reduce risk and accelerate learning. The opportunity was to translate that advantage into a go-to-market framework that made buying decisions easier for partners across the value chain. The strategy needed to express pragmatism (\u201cnot pushing mycelium if it isn\u2019t the right fit\u201d), speed (leveraging absorbed infrastructure), and risk reduction (integrating sustainability and viability considerations early) in language that commercial teams and external partners could act on.",
      "Design Approach",
      "I designed and facilitated three focused workshops with the mycelium team, bringing together scientists, designers, and commercialization stakeholders so the go-to-market model could be aligned, testable, and decision-ready. The first workshop centered on shared understanding: mapping current capabilities, constraints, and what was truly differentiating (infrastructure, multidisciplinary teams, integrated testing, and piloting). The second workshop aligned expectations: translating technical strengths into customer outcomes, clarifying target segments, and defining what \u201cvalue\u201d means for each buyer type. The third workshop validated and prioritized: stress-testing service concepts, selecting the most feasible market entry paths, and agreeing on what to package now versus what to develop next. From these workshops, I shaped the service design outputs value proposition structure, customer journey logic, and the service packaging that made the offering legible for B2B buyers\u2014while keeping the narrative NDA-safe and focused on a generalizable model rather than sensitive technical detail.",
      "Service Model & Packaging",
      "The work resulted in a clear, modular service portfolio designed around how different customers buy innovation. Instead of one monolithic \u201cmycelium leather offering,\u201d the model articulated multiple entry points so partners could engage at the stage that matched their risk appetite and maturity. At a high level, the service portfolio was packaged into three complementary lanes: material-oriented collaboration (from demos to tailored development), consulting-oriented support (from value-chain optimization to ecosystem partnerships and commercialization decisions), and quality/inspection-style work (helping evaluate inputs and feasibility pathways in a circular economy context). This made it easier to move from exploratory conversations to scoped engagements with clear expectations. Finally, the go-to-market framing translated deep-tech realities into commercial clarity: who the service is for, what outcomes it enables, what proof is needed at each step, and how to build momentum from pilots toward scalable partnerships while staying honest about what\u2019s possible and what still requires iteration.",
      "Outcomes",
      "The outcome was a portfolio-safe go-to-market structure that helped VTT present mycelium leather as a credible, partner-friendly innovation platform supported by clear service packages, segment-specific messaging, and prioritized market entry pathways. The model increased internal alignment across research, design, and commercialization stakeholders and created a practical foundation for structured customer discussions and pilot scoping. By framing the offering around speed, risk reduction, and pragmatism rather than only technology, the work positioned VTT to engage a broader ecosystem, accelerate learning cycles with partners, and move from \u201cinteresting innovation\u201d toward repeatable commercial traction.",

      "Reflection",
      "This project reminded me that deep-tech commercialization often fails in the \u201ctranslation layer\u201dt he gap between what a technology can do and how a customer decides to adopt it. My role was to design that translation: turning multidisciplinary capability into a clear service model, and turning technical strengths into outcomes that procurement, innovation, and product teams can evaluate. Facilitating the three workshops also reinforced a pattern I\u2019ve seen repeatedly: alignment is a deliverable. When scientists, designers, and commercial stakeholders share a single operating narrative\u2014and a prioritized model to act on\u2014execution becomes faster and calmer. This experience continues to shape how I lead go-to-market and transformation work: designing the structure that makes complex innovation usable, adoptable, and scalable, without compromising integrity or trust.",

      "Although the Finnish legal system operates with strong democratic foundations, the experience of participating in it as a witness is often unclear, stressful, and fragmented. Witnesses frequently arrive without knowing their rights, their role, or what the day will look like. In partnership with the Finnish Court Administration (Tuomioistuinlaitos), our multidisciplinary team set out to deeply understand the lived experience of witnesses and design tools that would bring clarity, predictability, and emotional support into a traditionally rigid system. The project began as a research exploration and culminated in a real, implemented public-facing solution now used nationwide.",
      "Understanding a System Resistant to Change",
      "We immersed ourselves in the reality of witnesses through interviews, on-site observations, and participation in court sessions. This helped us capture the emotional highs and lows of the experience, as well as the system-driven constraints that shape it. Using a snowball sampling method, we interviewed witnesses directly at the courts during their waiting periods\u2014moments when emotions and memories were still fresh. Observing proceedings firsthand gave us an inside view of procedural complexity and the unintended intimidation built into the system. This phase revealed a fundamental truth: the legal system works for legal professionals, but not for the everyday people it serves.",
      "Building Shared Understanding Across the Legal Community",
      "We brought together judges, lawyers, clerks, interpreters, and court representatives in a virtual co-creation workshop designed to bridge the gaps between their differing viewpoints and work cultures. After introducing participants to Miro, we guided them through a structured series of activities that surfaced hidden inconsistencies, revealed system-wide bottlenecks, and made visible the workarounds each profession relied on in isolation. Through open dialogue and shared mapping, the group collectively identified which challenges were universal across courts and which ones had the highest potential for meaningful change. As the session progressed, fragmented observations transformed into a coherent narrative. For the first time, every stakeholder could see the entire experience through the witness\u2019s eyes. This collaborative effort culminated in the creation of the first cross-role witness journey map for the Finnish courts, a foundation that aligned legal professionals around a shared understanding of the problems and the opportunities for improvement.",
      "Delivering Clarity, Confidence & Emotional Reassurance",
      "With the insights aligned and priorities clearly defined, we moved into designing a solution that could fit naturally within the legal system without adding operational burden. The outcome was a two-part communication experience, the Witness Journey Card and a multilingual explainer video crafted to support witnesses from the moment they receive their summons until the moment they leave the courtroom. The journey card, now included with the official summons letter, visually guides the witness through each stage of the process in simple, human language. It sets expectations, clarifies rights, and prepares the witness emotionally for what is often an overwhelming experience. A QR code connects users to a short animated video, translated into multiple languages, that explains the same journey with visuals and voiceover to ensure accessibility for diverse audiences. Following refinement and testing, the Finnish Courts formally adopted the enhanced version of this guidance. It is now publicly available on their official website, marking the transition of our prototype into a national resource supporting witnesses across Finland.",
      "From Concept to National Rollout",
      "The project evolved from an exploratory research initiative into a nationally recognized improvement to the Finnish legal system. By creating the first unified witness experience framework in Finland, the courts gained a clear and actionable understanding of the journey from the witness\u2019s perspective\u2014something that had never existed before. This framework now acts as a reference point for ongoing service improvements across jurisdictions. Early assessments indicate that witnesses are entering the courts feeling more prepared, more confident, and less anxious. The clarity provided through the journey card and explainer video reduces uncertainty and helps individuals understand their rights, responsibilities, and what to expect at every step. The introduction of consistent, accessible information has also created measurable operational benefits. Courts report fewer repetitive inquiries and less confusion at early touchpoints, contributing to an estimated 10\u201315% improvement in staff efficiency as resources can be redirected toward essential tasks instead of repeated explanations. Most importantly, the concept moved beyond a prototype and into official use. The Finnish Courts have now integrated the enhanced witness guidance\u2014including the journey card and multilingual video\u2014into their public communication channels. The material is published nationwide and supports witnesses across Finland, marking a meaningful shift toward more humane, transparent, and user-centered legal processes. Here is a link for the end solution.",

      "Reflection",
      "This project proved that even in highly structured, bureaucratic environments, human-centered design can unlock meaningful transformation. Working with the Finnish courts required deep sensitivity to legal constraints, information accuracy, and the emotional vulnerability of witnesses. The collaboration between service design and legal expertise was instrumental to the project\u2019s success. If repeating this project, I would plan for even longer implementation cycles, as processes and approvals in legal institutions move slowly\u2014but steadily when aligned with stakeholder trust. Seeing the solution implemented and used by real witnesses across Finland is a powerful reminder of why I do this work: design can make public systems more humane.",
