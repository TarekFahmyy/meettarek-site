USAID partnered with APOPO to accelerate early TB detection using an unexpected but highly effective, HeroRATs, African pouched rats trained to detect TB-positive sputum samples through scent.\n\nAs the Innovation Expert on the USAID side, I supported the initiative by mapping the operational ecosystem, identifying workflow gaps between laboratories, clinics, and APOPO facilities, and helping design scalable service processes that could be adopted by public health partners. The goal was to create a reliable, repeatable, and community-centered diagnostic service model capable of identifying more TB cases faster and at a fraction of traditional costs.","Understanding the Detection Bottleneck","Microscopy, the primary diagnostic tool in many clinics, misses a significant number of TB-positive cases, especially when patients have low bacterial loads. Clinics in Tanzania and Mozambique faced overwhelmed labs, limited staff, and slow turnaround times, leading to delayed treatment and continued community spread.\n\nMy role involved analyzing the end-to-end diagnostic journey, identifying where cases were lost, and designing a service blueprint that integrated HeroRAT screening into existing health systems with minimal disruption while maximizing detection yield.","Designing for Scale","To scale the program, we needed more than rats; we needed a service system. I facilitated co-creation sessions with APOPO trainers, clinicians, and USAID’s health and M&E teams to define the standardized sample transfer flows, better understand the quality assurance protocols, and try to make sense of the unified reporting mechanism for clinics, aiming to create a predictable daily screening rhythm utilizing HeroRAT capacity.\n\nThese design interventions strengthened the reliability of rat-based TB detection and gave clinics confidence in adopting the innovation.","Building Trust in an Unconventional Solution","Introducing an unconventional diagnostic tool required sensitivity and strong communication. Many clinicians were skeptical about using rats for medical screening. I worked with USAID communications and APOPO’s outreach team to develop evidence-based narratives, visual explanations, and field demonstrations that emphasized scientific rigor, accuracy rates, and speed.\n\nThis human-centered approach helped shift perceptions, increasing adoption and fostering collaboration across clinics.","Impact","The redesigned diagnostic workflow enabled HeroRATs to screen hundreds of samples per day, reducing detection time from days to minutes. Clinics using the service reported up to 45% more TB-positive cases identified than through microscopy alone, ensuring that previously undiagnosed patients received timely treatment.\n\nThis service design effort strengthened USAID’s ability to scale the innovation across partner clinics and contributed to a more resilient TB-detection ecosystem.","+45%","Increase in TB case detection","Clinics identified significantly more positive cases compared to microscopy alone.","20min","Rapid screening capability","One HeroRAT could evaluate what took labs days to process. 100+ Samples in 20 minutes.","3X","Faster Workflow","Optimized sample journey.

Being on the USAID side allowed me to collaborate with people from Tanzania, Mozambique, Belgium, and the United States, each with different perspectives, realities, and hopes for what better healthcare could look like. Bringing all these voices together wasn’t always easy, but it taught me what true co-creation feels like in environments where every decision can change someone’s life.  Introducing the idea of using rats for medical diagnostics was, honestly, a challenge. It was unconventional, unfamiliar, and at times difficult for stakeholders to imagine. I spent months pitching an idea that sounded “too different” and sometimes even “too strange” to be taken seriously. But once we shifted our communication strategy, listened deeply to each audience, and shaped the story around their concerns, the doors that once felt closed began to open.  That experience taught me that innovations don’t fail because they lack value; they fail because the story around them doesn’t meet people where they are.  Receiving a U.S. Government Award for this work was an honour, but the real reward was witnessing communities trust this solution and seeing patients get diagnosed sooner because of it. This project reminded me why I chose service design: to connect unlikely ideas, unlikely partners, and unlikely solutions and help them become real, human, and impactful.","more projects","2019","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Mapping India's Digital Financial Inclusion Journey and Driving Last-Mile Adoption","2014–2020","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Designing a Paperless-by-Default Government at Global Scale","2023","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Designing Sustainability into Everyday Retail at National Scale","Go to top","Email","hello@meettarek.com","Current Residence","Helsinki, Finland","Current time","4:22:12 PM","Socials","Linkedin","Twitter","Great ideas start with a hello.","made by Tarek Fahmy","@ All rights reserved","Site map","Home","Projects","About","Process","Testimonials","Selected Projects","AI & AUTOMATION","STRATEGY & INNOVATION","DIRECT SOCIAL IMPACT","EXPERIENCE DESIGN","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/projects/bio-innovation"},"/projects/circular-economy-bm":{"version":1,"title":"Tarek Fahmy","description":"Tarek Fahmy as a strategic consultant, transformation advisor, organizational designer and experience designer portfolio and case studies.","keywords":"","h1":[],"h2":["Tangible Results That Strengthened Future Circular Initiatives","You might also like","Let's Talk About Your Vision"],"h3":["Advancing Circular Economy Business Models (Open Innovation Camp)","Establishing a Shared Framework for Circular Value Creation","Co-creation Across Cultures, Time Zones & Expertise","Designing & Validating CEBM Prototypes"],"h4":["Building the Next Generation of Circular Economy Innovative Business Model - EU","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels"],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["Close","2021","Services","Facilitation • Service Design • Research • Co-creation Leadership","Client","Circle4Life","Team","Multidisciplinary team of service designers, researchers & circular economy industry specialists","Research","Co-definition","Prototyping","Expert Validation","Refinement","Overview","The Innovation Camp brought together global circular economy professionals to test and strengthen the Circular Economy Business Model (CEBM). Over two intensive days, participants explored how sustainable consumption, reuse & recycling, and end-user co-creation can shape future-ready business models.\n\nMy role was to design and facilitate high-impact sessions, guide multidisciplinary teams through structured decision-making, and ensure that each CEBM prototype was validated with experts from diverse industries—including lighting, meat production, repair services, and energy.\n\nThe result was a unified understanding of how circular design principles can translate into commercially viable, scalable, and environmentally responsible business strategies.","Understanding Circular Challenges Through Collective Insight","The camp began with defining what circular value means across industries. Through interviews, pre-work exercises, and co-analysis, we aligned participants around the three pillars of CEBM: sustainable consumption, reuse & recycling, and end-user co-creation.\n\nMy focus was on leading the Sustainable Consumption stream—guiding participants to uncover systemic gaps, behavioural barriers, and market opportunities. This foundation ensured that every prototype aligned with both environmental goals and real business constraints.","Bringing Together Global Perspectives","With over 200 professionals from multiple countries, alignment was critical. I facilitated sessions that helped participants quickly build trust, understand cultural nuances, and navigate differences in sustainability maturity levels.\n\nWe used Howspace, Miro, and Zoom to structure group thinking, validate assumptions, and ensure inclusive participation. Despite distance and time-zone challenges, we created a seamless, psychologically safe environment where experts openly shared challenges and perspectives.\n\nThis alignment enabled the group to move from abstract circular concepts to practical, testable business model prototypes.","Turning Circular Principles into Real Solutions","Five business model prototypes were developed and tested with industry experts. I led two key sessions, one for the lighting industry and one for the meat production industry, where we explored how circularity could reshape their operations.\n\nUsing structured voting, rapid prototyping tools, and guided discussions, we validated:\n1-Market desirability\n2-Technical feasibility\n3-Circular impact\n4-Business viability\n\nThe facilitation hierarchy, pre-designed materials, and clear instructions ensured smooth execution, even with large groups.\nBy the end of day two, each prototype had a refined value proposition, tested assumptions, and a clear pathway for further development.","Advancing Circular Thinking at Scale","The Innovation Camp delivered high-value insights for circular model owners, businesses, and sustainability leaders.

The camp made it clear how differently participants defined “circular value” depending on their industry, culture, or background. For some, it meant material reuse. For others, it meant behavioural change, long-term design commitment, or community involvement. The value of the camp came from creating a space where these interpretations could coexist — and then be aligned into a shared definition.  Visual facilitation also played a critical role. Having a skilled illustrator capturing insights in real time helped participants see complexity become clarity. It allowed the group to track emerging patterns, reduce abstraction, and build a shared mental model — something especially important when participants come from technical or scientific fields.  Another key learning was the importance of bringing business leaders into the same room early, aligning their expectations, and making trade-offs transparent. Circularity touches supply chains, investment models, and long-term risk planning — none of which can move forward unless leadership alignment is strong and explicit.  From a facilitation standpoint, the workshop highlighted how essential a well-designed playbook is for large-scale events. Clear roles, escalation paths, timing rules, and communication scripts ensured the experience remained smooth despite cultural differences, multiple time zones, and highly technical discussions. Without this backbone, the complexity would have overwhelmed the process.  If repeating this project, I would expand the pre-work exercises to deepen alignment before sessions begin — especially considering the diverse mix of expertise. More importantly, I would integrate early diagnostic surveys to surface assumptions and misconceptions before participants arrive, accelerating convergence in the live sessions.  Overall, this project reinforced the importance of structure, psychological safety, and visual thinking in tackling complex sustainability challenges. It strengthened my ability to guide large-scale co-creation, translate circular models into practical actions, and support global teams as they work toward a more regenerative, resilient future.","more projects","2019","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Mapping India's Digital Financial Inclusion Journey and Driving Last-Mile Adoption","2014–2020","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Designing a Paperless-by-Default Government at Global Scale","2023","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Designing Sustainability into Everyday Retail at National Scale","Go to top","Email","hello@meettarek.com","Current Residence","Helsinki, Finland","Current time","4:22:12 PM","Socials","Linkedin","Twitter","Great ideas start with a hello.","made by Tarek Fahmy","@ All rights reserved","Site map","Home","Projects","About","Process","Testimonials","Selected Projects","AI & AUTOMATION","STRATEGY & INNOVATION","DIRECT SOCIAL IMPACT","EXPERIENCE DESIGN","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/projects/circular-economy-bm"},"/projects/digital-future":{"version":1,"title":"Tarek Fahmy","description":"Tarek Fahmy as a strategic consultant, transformation advisor, organizational designer and experience designer portfolio and case studies.","keywords":"","h1":[],"h2":["A Platform Designed for Real Work, Not Assumptions","You might also like","Let's Talk About Your Vision"],"h3":["Reimagining Digital Future","Understanding the Reality Behind the Work","Building a Shared Understanding Across Markets","From Pain Points to Practical Future Solutions"],"h4":["Modernizing a 170-year-old organization by designing a platform that reflects how people actually work - United Kingdom","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels"],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["Close","2021","Services","Service Design, User Research, Workshop Design & Facilitation, UX Strategy, Prototyping, Pitching.","Client","BMI Group","Team","Senior Service Designer, Senior Project Manager, Client lead, Data Analyst, UI Designer, Enterprise Solution Architect.","Discover","Align","Co-Create","Prototype","Validate","Overview","BMI Group, one of the world’s largest roofing manufacturers, operated on systems that no longer reflected real work practices across its global markets. Employees relied heavily on manual workarounds and informal tools that existed outside official systems, creating inconsistency, inefficiency, and knowledge gaps.\n\nMy role as Senior Service Designer was to uncover these hidden behaviors, align global teams around a unified workflow vision, and design the foundation for a new digital platform that supports real-world operations—not just idealized processes.","We began by conducting ethnographic research, contextual interviews, and workflow shadowing across multiple countries. This revealed disconnects between documented processes and the lived experiences of employees. Much of the core work happened “outside the system” in spreadsheets, emails, WhatsApp messages, and personal notes.\n\nThese insights formed a clear starting point: BMI’s tools did not reflect how people actually work and transformation had to begin with understanding that truth.","I designed and facilitated a series of co-creation workshops that brought together teams from multiple markets, each with its own ways of working, cultures, and operational histories. In these sessions, we openly surfaced and mapped local workarounds, uncovered universal pain points, and revealed systemic bottlenecks created by outdated tools and fragmented processes.\n\nAs the discussions deepened, teams were able to prioritize the most critical challenges for redesign, often realizing for the first time how similar their struggles were, despite being spread across different regions. A major turning point was when the group collaboratively built their first unified customer journey map, creating shared visibility into how employees and customers experience the service end-to-end.\n\nFor many participants, this was the first moment where a collective picture of the organization’s challenges truly emerged, forming a strong foundation for alignment and future transformation.","DESIGN","Using insights gathered during discovery and alignment, we ideated user-centered solutions and translated them into a high-fidelity prototype for a new platform. This prototype reflected real workflows, integrated user priorities, and aligned business requirements with operational realities.\n\nThrough iterative testing and refinement, we progressively validated and improved the experience directly with employees.","IMPACT","The project delivered BMI a clear and actionable roadmap for digital transformation—one grounded in genuine user behaviour rather than organisational assumptions. The high-fidelity prototype became the company’s first unified vision of a future platform that reflects real workflows, operational constraints, and strategic business goals.\n\nThe work did not stop at design. The validated prototype and service blueprint were handed over to the development teams as a foundation for implementation, ensuring continuity from concept to execution. The project also expanded into change management and training readiness, preparing teams across multiple markets to adopt the new ways of working.\n\nThis marked a decisive shift from fragmented, manual processes toward a coherent, scalable, and human-centred digital ecosystem built for long-term growth.","45%","Increased workflow efficiency","Teams were able to complete core tasks faster and with fewer errors.","80%","Reduced reliance on “shadow systems”","Enabled employees to move more of their daily work into a single, consistent environment.","35%","Improved cross-market alignment and transparency","Markets reported greater clarity and consistency in how work should be executed across regions.","70%","Increased employee readiness for platform adoption by approximately","Co-creation workshops and user testing showed a measurable rise in confidence and willingness to transition.","// BMI // Internal Solution Demo","Reflection","Leading this project reinforced an essential truth: technology succeeds only when it aligns with real human behavior. BMI’s employees were highly skilled, yet forced to rely on outdated tools and improvised systems. Our work revealed not only operational pain points but also cultural and communication gaps between markets.  What made the difference was creating a shared space where diverse teams—from factory floors to commercial offices—could map their realities, challenge assumptions, and co-create solutions. As a lead designer, my role was to translate these human insights into a strategic direction that the business could confidently invest in.  The biggest learning? Modernization is not just about introducing a new platform—it’s about creating the conditions for people to let go of old habits and adopt better ones. This project strengthened my belief that service design is most powerful when it brings clarity, empathy, and alignment to complex organizational environments. It is worth to mentioning all visuals shown are conceptual or anonymized representations used for demonstration purposes.

Witnesses frequently arrive without knowing their rights, their role, or what the day will look like.\n\nIn partnership with the Finnish Court Administration (Tuomioistuinlaitos), our multidisciplinary team set out to deeply understand the lived experience of witnesses and design tools that would bring clarity, predictability, and emotional support into a traditionally rigid system.\n\nThe project began as a research exploration and culminated in a real, implemented public-facing solution now used nationwide.","Understanding a System Resistant to Change","We immersed ourselves in the reality of witnesses through interviews, on-site observations, and participation in court sessions. This helped us capture the emotional highs and lows of the experience, as well as the system-driven constraints that shape it.\n\nUsing a snowball sampling method, we interviewed witnesses directly at the courts during their waiting periods—moments when emotions and memories were still fresh. Observing proceedings firsthand gave us an inside view of procedural complexity and the unintended intimidation built into the system.\n\nThis phase revealed a fundamental truth: the legal system works for legal professionals, but not for the everyday people it serves.","Building Shared Understanding Across the Legal Community","We brought together judges, lawyers, clerks, interpreters, and court representatives in a virtual co-creation workshop designed to bridge the gaps between their differing viewpoints and work cultures. After introducing participants to Miro, we guided them through a structured series of activities that surfaced hidden inconsistencies, revealed system-wide bottlenecks, and made visible the workarounds each profession relied on in isolation. Through open dialogue and shared mapping, the group collectively identified which challenges were universal across courts and which ones had the highest potential for meaningful change.\n\nAs the session progressed, fragmented observations transformed into a coherent narrative. For the first time, every stakeholder could see the entire experience through the witness’s eyes. This collaborative effort culminated in the creation of the first cross-role witness journey map for the Finnish courts, a foundation that aligned legal professionals around a shared understanding of the problems and the opportunities for improvement.","Delivering Clarity, Confidence & Emotional Reassurance","With the insights aligned and priorities clearly defined, we moved into designing a solution that could fit naturally within the legal system without adding operational burden. The outcome was a two-part communication experience, the Witness Journey Card and a multilingual explainer video crafted to support witnesses from the moment they receive their summons until the moment they leave the courtroom.\n\nThe journey card, now included with the official summons letter, visually guides the witness through each stage of the process in simple, human language. It sets expectations, clarifies rights, and prepares the witness emotionally for what is often an overwhelming experience. A QR code connects users to a short animated video, translated into multiple languages, that explains the same journey with visuals and voiceover to ensure accessibility for diverse audiences.\n\nFollowing refinement and testing, the Finnish Courts formally adopted the enhanced version of this guidance. It is now publicly available on their official website, marking the transition of our prototype into a national resource supporting witnesses across Finland.","From Concept to National Rollout","The project evolved from an exploratory research initiative into a nationally recognized improvement to the Finnish legal system. By creating the first unified witness experience framework in Finland, the courts gained a clear and actionable understanding of the journey from the witness’s perspective—something that had never existed before. This framework now acts as a reference point for ongoing service improvements across jurisdictions.\n\nEarly assessments indicate that witnesses are entering the courts feeling more prepared, more confident, and less anxious. The clarity provided through the journey card and explainer video reduces uncertainty and helps individuals understand their rights, responsibilities, and what to expect at every step.\n\nThe introduction of consistent, accessible information has also created measurable operational benefits. Courts report fewer repetitive inquiries and less confusion at early touchpoints, contributing to an estimated 10–15% improvement in staff efficiency as resources can be redirected toward essential tasks instead of repeated explanations.\n\nMost importantly, the concept moved beyond a prototype and into official use. The Finnish Courts have now integrated the enhanced witness guidance—including the journey card and multilingual video—into their public communication channels. The material is published nationwide and supports witnesses across Finland, marking a meaningful shift toward more humane, transparent, and user-centered legal processes.

Working with the Finnish courts required deep sensitivity to legal constraints, information accuracy, and the emotional vulnerability of witnesses.  The collaboration between service design and legal expertise was instrumental to the project’s success. If repeating this project, I would plan for even longer implementation cycles, as processes and approvals in legal institutions move slowly—but steadily when aligned with stakeholder trust.  Seeing the solution implemented and used by real witnesses across Finland is a powerful reminder of why I do this work: design can make public systems more humane.","more projects","2019","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Mapping India's Digital Financial Inclusion Journey and Driving Last-Mile Adoption","2014–2020","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Designing a Paperless-by-Default Government at Global Scale","2023","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Designing Sustainability into Everyday Retail at National Scale","Go to top","Email","hello@meettarek.com","Current Residence","Helsinki, Finland","Current time","4:22:12 PM","Socials","Linkedin","Twitter","Great ideas start with a hello.","made by Tarek Fahmy","@ All rights reserved","Site map","Home","Projects","About","Process","Testimonials","Selected Projects","AI & AUTOMATION","STRATEGY & INNOVATION","DIRECT SOCIAL IMPACT","EXPERIENCE DESIGN","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/projects/witness-experince"},"/404":{"version":1,"title":"Tarek Fahmy Portfolio","description":"Tarek Fahmy Portfolio","keywords":"","h1":["404"],"h2":[],"h3":[],"h4":[],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["Projects","About","Services","Process","Testimonials","Looks like the page you're searching for took a detour","Back to home","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/404"},"/projects/city-services":{"version":1,"title":"Tarek Fahmy","description":"Tarek Fahmy as a strategic consultant, transformation advisor, organizational designer and experience designer portfolio and case studies.","keywords":"","h1":[],"h2":["A Foundation for More Inclusive Public Services","You might also like","Let's Talk About Your Vision"],"h3":["Improving City Services for Helsinki’s Diverse Communities","Listening to the Voices Often Left Out","Preparing the Ground for Honest Dialogue","Surfacing the Real Barriers to Access"],"h4":["Designing Public Services That Include Everyone - Finland","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels"],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["Close","2021","Services","User Research • Cultural Insights • Facilitation • Community Engagement","Client","City of Helsinki (Kuudes)","Team","Service Designers & Researchers from Kuudes, City of Helsinki representatives, Role: Lead researcher for Arabic-speaking community","Discover","Co-create","Make Sense of Data","Align","Strategy","Overview","Helsinki is one of Europe’s fastest-diversifying cities. Yet many residents, especially immigrants and non-native speakers, struggle to access or fully understand public services. Under the umbrella of Kuudes and with a brief from the City of Helsinki, we set out to deeply understand how Arabic-speaking residents experience municipal services, uncover barriers, and highlight gaps where service delivery does not meet community expectations. The goal: to build a foundation for more inclusive, accessible public services across the city of Helsinki.","Understanding Lived Realities","My role focused on generating deep insights from Arabic-speaking communities, one of Helsinki’s largest and most diverse immigrant groups. Through semi-structured group interviews and group discussions, which were conducted online, I built trust, encouraged honest storytelling, and explored how people navigate social, health, education, and employment services.\n\nEach conversation revealed the gap between intended service design and lived experience, highlighting barriers rooted in language, expectations, cultural norms, and system complexity.","Building Trust & Participation","Because technology, timing, and unfamiliarity with public institutions often prevent meaningful participation, I personally contacted each participant beforehand.

One powerful insight from this project was how differently the word “assist” is understood across cultures. For some, assistance means guidance and clear instructions. For others, it implies emotional reassurance, hands-on support, or even advocacy. These interpretations shift based on a person’s upbringing, education, cultural norms, and past experiences with institutions. When a system defines assistance one way, but a community understands it another way, friction is inevitable.  If repeating this project, I would push for even broader community participation across more neighborhoods, and deeper collaboration with city employees themselves. The gap between resident expectations and institutional structures is still significant—and closing it requires cultural competence, empathy, and a higher level of design maturity within public systems.  This project strengthened Helsinki’s ability to create services that reflect the people who live here, not just the structures that manage them. And that is the true foundation of inclusive public service design.","more projects","2019","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Mapping India's Digital Financial Inclusion Journey and Driving Last-Mile Adoption","2014–2020","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Designing a Paperless-by-Default Government at Global Scale","2023","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Designing Sustainability into Everyday Retail at National Scale","Go to top","Email","hello@meettarek.com","Current Residence","Helsinki, Finland","Current time","4:22:12 PM","Socials","Linkedin","Twitter","Great ideas start with a hello.","made by Tarek Fahmy","@ All rights reserved","Site map","Home","Projects","About","Process","Testimonials","Selected Projects","AI & AUTOMATION","STRATEGY & INNOVATION","DIRECT SOCIAL IMPACT","EXPERIENCE DESIGN","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/projects/city-services"},"/projects/digital-vultures":{"version":1,"title":"Tarek Fahmy","description":"Tarek Fahmy as a strategic consultant, transformation advisor, organizational designer and experience designer portfolio and case studies.","keywords":"","h1":[],"h2":["From Flight Paths to Cleaner Ground","You might also like","Let's Talk About Your Vision"],"h3":["Vultures Mapping Illegal Dumps in Lima","Using the Sky to Reveal Hidden Dumps","Designing the Environmental Intelligence Layer","Making High-Tech Vultures Understandable and Human"],"h4":["Turning Vultures into High-Tech Environmental Sensors","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels"],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["Close","2016","Services","Service Design, Environmental Data Strategy, Digital Communications, Behaviour-Change Design, Stakeholder Engagement","Client","USAID (Peruvian Ministry of Environment)","Team","Lead Service & Communications Designer (USAID), Environmental Policy Team, Peruvian Ministry of Environment Data & GIS Specialists, Creative / Media Team.","Illegal Waste Mapping","Environmental Data Intelligence","Civic Engagement & Reporting","Urban Sanitation Innovation","Public–Government Collaboration","Overview","Lima produces thousands of tons of waste every day, and a significant share ends up in illegal dumps along rivers, roadsides, and informal areas, far from official landfills. Traditional monitoring systems couldn’t keep up with the scale of the problem. Gallinazo Avisa (“Vultures Warn”) took an unconventional path: equipping rescued black vultures with GPS trackers and GoPro cameras so they could help locate hidden garbage hotspots from the sky and feed that data into a live, public map. \n\nAs the Innovation Expert on the USAID side, I worked at the intersection of technology, environment, and public engagement: shaping how vulture-generated data would be translated into actionable insights for authorities, and how the story would be told so that residents didn’t just watch vultures fly, they understood the problem and felt invited to act.","Seeing What the City Couldn’t","Lima has only a handful of official landfills for nearly 10 million residents; the rest of the city’s waste often leaks into informal dumping sites that are hard to track from the ground. \n\nVultures, however, naturally seek out decaying waste. Instead of fighting this behaviour, Gallinazo Avisa turned it into an environmental asset: by fitting selected birds with lightweight GPS units and GoPro cameras, their flight paths and footage could reveal where illegal dumps were concentrated. \n\nMy role involved mapping the end-to-end service flow, from vulture flight and data capture, to GPS and video stream ingestion, to visualizing dumps on a live map, to coordinate municipal response.\n\nThe design challenge was to make this system reliable enough for authorities to act on, while still being intuitive and engaging for the public.","From Raw Flight Data to Actionable Maps","Vultures generate messy, continuous movement data. What city officials and citizens needed, instead, were clear signals: “Here is a likely dump site. Here is where to act.”\n\nWorking with environmental authorities, data specialists, and the creative team, I helped design:\n1- Data rules for identifying potential dumping hotspots based on flight patterns and recorded footage.                                        2-A public-facing map where these hotspots could be visualized in near real time.\n\nTo mix them together and create a simple feedback loop linking citizen reports and vulture data, so both could reinforce each other. Instead of just broadcasting a message, we co-created a service ecosystem: vultures scan, systems map, authorities act, and residents participate.","Storytelling for a Strange but Powerful Idea","Pitching this concept was not easy. On paper, “we’re using vultures with cameras to fight garbage” sounded too unconventional, even humorous, for many stakeholders. Some worried it would undermine the seriousness of the waste problem; others were unsure people would engage with birds as “partners.”\n\nTogether with the communications team and local partners, I worked on humanizing the story:\n1- Giving each vulture a name and personality,\n2- Framing them as “dark superheroes” helping the city, and grounding all messaging in real health and environmental stakes, not just spectacle.\n\nBy tailoring how we communicated to different audiences, government leaders, local communities, youth, and media, we turned initial skepticism into curiosity, and curiosity into participation. Within weeks, the project had tens of thousands of interactions online and strong public recognition. And of course, data speaks louder than anything else at the end.","Impact","Gallinazo Avisa showed how nature, technology, and people can work together to tackle urban waste. Vultures equipped with GPS and cameras helped identify clusters of illegal dumps, feeding data into a live map that supported authorities’ decisions on where to intervene first.\n\nAt the same time, the project sparked broad public engagement. Residents followed the vultures online, learned about the scale of the waste problem, and contributed their own reports of polluted sites. This blend of environmental sensing and civic participation created a new kind of environmental service: one that made the invisible visible, and turned a stigmatized bird into a symbol of collective responsibility.","10","Vultures equipped with GPS + cameras","A trained squadron of scavengers became real-time environmental sensors over Lima.","City-wide","Illegal dump hotspots mapped","Flight data and video helped reveal hidden waste clusters across the metropolitan area.","20,000+","Early social interactions","In the first phase, the initiative quickly gathered online attention and reports from citizens.","100%","From data to action","Authorities gained a new decision-support tool, while citizens were invited to co-own the problem and its solutions.","// The selected images illustrate how GPS-equipped vultures, field teams, and digital mapping tools worked together to identify and visualize illegal waste sites across Lima. //","Reflection","Working on Gallinazo Avisa taught me how powerful unconventional innovation becomes when it is paired with the right story, the right communication approach, and a service system that truly respects the people it is meant to serve. I collaborated with incredible individuals from Peru, the United States, environmental NGOs, data scientists, and creative agencies, each bringing their own cultural rhythms, design languages, and expectations. The project became a living example of how diverse teams can create something none of us could have built alone.  Convincing stakeholders to take seriously the idea of using vultures equipped with GoPro cameras and GPS trackers was one of the most challenging phases of my career. At first, many people laughed, hesitated, or dismissed the concept as too strange to be a real environmental solution. But by deeply understanding each audience, their fears, motivations, pride, and frustrations, we reframed the narrative from “vultures with cameras” to “a new way to see what the city cannot.”  That shift changed everything. Once people understood the purpose, not just the technology, they leaned in. Authorities began to trust the data. Citizens began to participate. The city began to see itself from above.  For this work, I received an award from the American government, a recognition that meant a great deal to me, because it affirmed that bold ideas, when handled with empathy and cultural sensitivity, can become powerful tools for public good.","more projects","2019","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Mapping India's Digital Financial Inclusion Journey and Driving Last-Mile Adoption","2014–2020","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Designing a Paperless-by-Default Government at Global Scale","2023","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Designing Sustainability into Everyday Retail at National Scale","Go to top","Email","hello@meettarek.com","Current Residence","Helsinki, Finland","Current time","4:22:12 PM","Socials","Linkedin","Twitter","Great ideas start with a hello.","made by Tarek Fahmy","@ All rights reserved","Site map","Home","Projects","About","Process","Testimonials","Selected Projects","AI & AUTOMATION","STRATEGY & INNOVATION","DIRECT SOCIAL IMPACT","EXPERIENCE DESIGN","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/projects/digital-vultures"},"/projects/vtt-mycelium-leather":{"version":1,"title":"Tarek Fahmy","description":"Tarek Fahmy as a strategic consultant, transformation advisor, organizational designer and experience designer portfolio and case studies.","keywords":"","h1":[],"h2":["A Buyer-Ready Go-to-Market Structure for Commercial Strategy","You might also like","Let's Talk About Your Vision"],"h3":["Mycelium Leather Go-to-Market Strategy - VTT","A Fast-Moving Market Needed More Than a Great Material","Three Workshops to Move from Capability to a Prioritized Commercial Model","A Modular Service Portfolio for Different Buyers and Decision Cycles"],"h4":["Taking a Deep-Tech Material from Lab Proof to Market-Ready Offering","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels"],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["Close","2022","Services","Service Design, Go-to-Market Strategy Support, Workshop Facilitation, Research & Insight Synthesis, Value Proposition Design, Service Packaging, Ecosystem Mapping","Client","VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland","Team","VTT Mycelium Research Team, Material & Bioprocess Specialists, Designers, Commercial & IP Stakeholders, Consulting Partner Team","Biomaterials Commercialization","B2B Go-to-Market Design","Service Offering Packaging","Ecosystem & Partnership Strategy","Sustainability-by-Design","Overview","VTT had developed a scalable pathway for producing mycelium-based “leather-like” materials using industrially proven fermentation approaches, supported by experimentation to improve material performance and protect new innovations through IP. The challenge in 2022 wasn’t only technical feasibility; it was translating breakthrough capability into a clear, customer-ready go-to-market model that different industries could understand, trust, and adopt. \n\nAs Lead Service Designer, I assisted in shaping an NDA-safe commercialization narrative and service structure: clarifying who the offering is for, what problems it solves, and how a research organization can package deep-tech capabilities into actionable services, without overpromising, and without forcing a one-size-fits-all sales story.","Context & Opportunity","In 2022, mycelium leather sat at a market inflection point: brands and manufacturers were hungry for credible alternatives to animal leather and fossil-based synthetics, but the ecosystem was still early, fragmented, and full of scalability and consistency challenges. For many players, the bottleneck wasn’t interest it was reliable production, repeatable quality, and a clear path from prototype to product.\n\nVTT’s strength was uniquely positioned for this moment: multidisciplinary expertise, pilot infrastructure, and a “beyond the obvious” role as a neutral, trusted R&D institution able to reduce risk and accelerate learning. The opportunity was to translate that advantage into a go-to-market framework that made buying decisions easier for partners across the value chain. \n\nThe strategy needed to express pragmatism (“not pushing mycelium if it isn’t the right fit”), speed (leveraging absorbed infrastructure), and risk reduction (integrating sustainability and viability considerations early) in language that commercial teams and external partners could act on.","Design Approach","I designed and facilitated three focused workshops with the mycelium team, bringing together scientists, designers, and commercialization stakeholders so the go-to-market model could be aligned, testable, and decision-ready.\n\nThe first workshop centered on shared understanding: mapping current capabilities, constraints, and what was truly differentiating (infrastructure, multidisciplinary teams, integrated testing, and piloting). The second workshop aligned expectations: translating technical strengths into customer outcomes, clarifying target segments, and defining what “value” means for each buyer type. The third workshop validated and prioritized: stress-testing service concepts, selecting the most feasible market entry paths, and agreeing on what to package now versus what to develop next.\n\nFrom these workshops, I shaped the service design outputs value proposition structure, customer journey logic, and the service packaging that made the offering legible for B2B buyers—while keeping the narrative NDA-safe and focused on a generalizable model rather than sensitive technical detail.","Service Model & Packaging","The work resulted in a clear, modular service portfolio designed around how different customers buy innovation. Instead of one monolithic “mycelium leather offering,” the model articulated multiple entry points so partners could engage at the stage that matched their risk appetite and maturity.\n\nAt a high level, the service portfolio was packaged into three complementary lanes: material-oriented collaboration (from demos to tailored development), consulting-oriented support (from value-chain optimization to ecosystem partnerships and commercialization decisions), and quality/inspection-style work (helping evaluate inputs and feasibility pathways in a circular economy context). This made it easier to move from exploratory conversations to scoped engagements with clear expectations. \n\nFinally, the go-to-market framing translated deep-tech realities into commercial clarity: who the service is for, what outcomes it enables, what proof is needed at each step, and how to build momentum from pilots toward scalable partnerships while staying honest about what’s possible and what still requires iteration.","Outcomes","The outcome was a portfolio-safe go-to-market structure that helped VTT present mycelium leather as a credible, partner-friendly innovation platform supported by clear service packages, segment-specific messaging, and prioritized market entry pathways. The model increased internal alignment across research, design, and commercialization stakeholders and created a practical foundation for structured customer discussions and pilot scoping. \n\nBy framing the offering around speed, risk reduction, and pragmatism rather than only technology, the work positioned VTT to engage a broader ecosystem, accelerate learning cycles with partners, and move from “interesting innovation” toward repeatable commercial traction.","3","Alignment Workshops Delivered","From fragmented assumptions to a shared, validated, and prioritized commercialization model across science, design, and business stakeholders.","13×","Market Expansion in One Year","Market rise and jump from about $16M (2024) to $208–211M (2025)","44%","Projected CAGR Through 2033","Forecasts indicated sustained hypergrowth for mycelium leather.","1","Cohesive GTM Narrative","One unified, NDA-safe story connected capabilities to customer outcomes, making the offering legible, credible, and ready for external engagement.","// pictures are to demonstrate mycelium leather. //","Reflection","This project reminded me that deep-tech commercialization often fails in the “translation layer”t he gap between what a technology can do and how a customer decides to adopt it. My role was to design that translation: turning multidisciplinary capability into a clear service model, and turning technical strengths into outcomes that procurement, innovation, and product teams can evaluate.  Facilitating the three workshops also reinforced a pattern I’ve seen repeatedly: alignment is a deliverable. When scientists, designers, and commercial stakeholders share a single operating narrative—and a prioritized model to act on—execution becomes faster and calmer. This experience continues to shape how I lead go-to-market and transformation work: designing the structure that makes complex innovation usable, adoptable, and scalable, without compromising integrity or trust.","more projects","2019","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Mapping India's Digital Financial Inclusion Journey and Driving Last-Mile Adoption","2014–2020","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Designing a Paperless-by-Default Government at Global Scale","2023","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Designing Sustainability into Everyday Retail at National Scale","Go to top","Email","hello@meettarek.com","Current Residence","Helsinki, Finland","Current time","4:22:12 PM","Socials","Linkedin","Twitter","Great ideas start with a hello.","made by Tarek Fahmy","@ All rights reserved","Site map","Home","Projects","About","Process","Testimonials","Selected Projects","AI & AUTOMATION","STRATEGY & INNOVATION","DIRECT SOCIAL IMPACT","EXPERIENCE DESIGN","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/projects/vtt-mycelium-leather"},"/projects/india-digital-financial-inclusion":{"version":1,"title":"Tarek Fahmy","description":"Tarek Fahmy as a strategic consultant, transformation advisor, organizational designer and experience designer portfolio and case studies.","keywords":"","h1":[],"h2":["Research-Driven Recommendations Shaping India's Digital Finance Future","You might also like","Let's Talk About Your Vision"],"h3":["Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Understanding the Gap Between Access and Usage","Five Critical Learnings About Digital Payments and Financial Inclusion","A Multi-Layered Research and Implementation Strategy"],"h4":["Mapping India's Digital Financial Inclusion Journey and Driving Last-Mile Adoption","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Mycelium Leather Go-to-Market Strategy - VTT"],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["Close","2019","Services","User Research, Journey Mapping, Stakeholder Engagement, Ecosystem Analysis, Financial Inclusion Strategy, Digital Payments Research, Value Chain Analysis, Gender-Focused Design, Community Engagement, Impact Assessment","Client","USAID, mSTAR","Team","USAID mSTAR Project Team, FHI 360, IFMR-LEAD, Intellecap, Local Community Partners, Financial Sector Stakeholders, Government Representatives","Ecosystem Mapping","Community Engagement","Value Chain Analysis","Gender-Inclusive Design","Evidence-Based Recommendations","Overview","Between 2014 and 2018, India embarked on one of the world's most ambitious financial inclusion initiatives, bringing over 330 million people into the formal financial sector. As part of USAID's commitment to support India's digital financial inclusion agenda, I contributed to comprehensive research examining how digital payments could catalyze meaningful financial inclusion for underserved populations across urban and rural India.\n\nThis project combined macro-level ecosystem mapping with micro-level field research in Jaipur, Odisha, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand to understand the drivers and barriers of digital payment adoption among merchants and consumers, particularly focusing on women, rural communities, and low-income populations.","CONTEXT & CHALLENGE","India has seen unprecedented growth in bank account ownership through the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). However, access did not translate into active use, 48% of account holders made no deposits or withdrawals, revealing a critical gap between financial inclusion on paper and meaningful engagement in practice.\n\nThe core challenge was not account penetration, but driving sustained usage of digital financial services. The research set out to understand why digital payments were not scaling at the same pace as bank accounts, what would motivate merchants and customers to shift from cash to digital, and how digital payments could function as an effective on-ramp to deeper financial inclusion, rather than a standalone intervention.\n\nTo address these questions, the work focused on two distinct but interconnected environments. In urban Jaipur, the CATALYST program tested ecosystem-level approaches with 7,500 individuals and 1,000 merchants, examining adoption dynamics across consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and service providers. In parallel, rural interventions applied value chain–based approaches in dairy (Odisha), food and beverage (Maharashtra), and poultry (Jharkhand), exploring how digital payments could be embedded into everyday economic activity across agricultural and informal markets.\n\nTogether, these contexts allowed the team to examine both system-level constraints and ground-level behaviors, bridging policy ambition with lived financial realities.","INSIGHTS","Despite rapid technological advancement, the program demonstrated that human interaction remains critical at the last mile. Building trust and capability among first-time digital finance users required intensive, hands-on support. For example, onboarding just 101 new account holders required five field staff working for approximately 30 days, highlighting that scaling technology does not eliminate the need for human facilitation.\n\nAdoption of digital finance was also closely linked to aspiration and identity. For many users, particularly younger participants, using digital payments symbolized belonging to “Digital Bharat” and aligning with a modern, forward-looking vision of India. Digital finance was not only a functional tool but a marker of social and economic progress.\n\nThe work further revealed that product design is a major, yet often underestimated, barrier to inclusion. Most digital finance applications were built for urban, affluent, English-speaking users, unintentionally excluding large segments of the population. Products were frequently data-intensive, overly complex, and lacked meaningful multi-language or low-literacy support.\n\nAt the same time, cash remained highly resilient. Strong status quo bias persisted, with 55% of non-adopting merchants citing lack of customer demand as the primary reason for not accepting digital payments. For many users, cash continued to represent security, trust, liquidity, and simplicity, values that digital alternatives had not yet fully replaced.\n\nFinally, the program challenged the assumption that digital payments automatically lead to financial inclusion. Digitizing merchant transactions alone did not result in poverty reduction or deeper financial resilience unless accompanied by broader ecosystem interventions, including financial literacy, relevant product design, trust-building, and supportive policy frameworks.","APPROACH","The work combined urban experimentation, rural value chain pilots, and macro-level ecosystem analysis to understand and unlock scalable pathways for inclusive digital payments adoption.\n\nWithin the Urban CATALYST Program in Jaipur, along with my team, we conducted a comprehensive mapping of the digital payments ecosystem, identifying key stakeholders, infrastructure gaps, and high-potential opportunity areas. This was complemented by deep ethnographic research in low-income neighborhoods such as Bhatta Basti, providing insight into everyday financial behaviors and trust dynamics. The program partnered with five fintech incubators to pilot and refine last-mile payment solutions, while simultaneously digitizing pharmaceutical and dairy supply chains to embed digital payments into routine commercial activity. Over a 20-month period, we provided intensive, hands-on merchant support, including onboarding, training, and troubleshooting, to ensure sustained adoption rather than short-term uptake.\n\nIn parallel, rural value chain pilots focused on sectors with high female participation, including dairy, food and beverage, and poultry. We worked directly with stakeholders like farmers, merchants, and aggregators to digitize B2B transactions and integrate digital payments into existing trading relationships. These pilots examined gender dynamics and financial empowerment outcomes while testing adoption patterns across different farmer profiles, from subsistence-based producers to more aspirational, growth-oriented actors.\n\nAt the macro ecosystem level, the work included extensive stakeholder interviews with senior government officials, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) representatives, fintech leaders, and development-sector experts. This qualitative insight was combined with analysis of national-level data on UPI growth, payment bank performance, and account dormancy. The team also mapped the broader policy landscape, including Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar, Direct Benefit Transfers, and the long-term impacts of demonetization, to understand how regulation, infrastructure, and policy incentives shaped adoption on the ground.","IMPACT","The research culminated in a comprehensive Journey Map Report, published by USAID/mSTAR, which has since informed policy dialogue and private-sector strategy across India’s digital financial services ecosystem. The work provided a rare, end-to-end view of how digital finance evolved between 2014 and 2018, linking national policy ambitions with lived user experiences on the ground.\n\nKey Deliverables included a 54-page Journey Map Report documenting India’s digital financial services journey, alongside evidence-based recommendations tailored for the Government of India, private-sector actors, and development partners. Additional outputs comprised technical reports on fintech incubator programs, supply chain digitization, and gender dynamics, as well as learning notes capturing insights on merchant behavior, credit linkages, and mechanisms for driving sustained behavior change.\n\nThe work translated into clear strategic recommendations across stakeholder groups. For the government, recommendations focused on clarifying Aadhaar-related regulations, embedding a stronger gender lens into the continuation of PMJDY, and investing in shared digital infrastructure to reduce fragmentation. For the private sector, the research emphasized the need to simplify application design and user experience, innovate around relevant savings products, and develop targeted strategies for engaging youth and first-time digital users. For the development sector, guidance centered on supporting inclusive business models through patient capital and strengthening the evidence base on how digital financial services contribute to poverty reduction and economic resilience.\n\nOverall, the research demonstrated that meaningful financial inclusion requires a shift from access to active usage. Digital payments alone are not sufficient; they must be embedded within broader, human-centered ecosystems that respond to diverse user needs, literacy levels, trust dynamics, and aspirations in order to deliver lasting inclusion and impact.","330M+","PEOPLE BROUGHT INTO FORMAL FINANCIAL SECTOR","Opened bank accounts between 2014-2017","7,500","INDIVIDUALS CONVERTED TO DIGITAL PAYMENT USERS","Closing the gap between rich and poor from 16% to just 5%.","80%","WOMEN BECAME COMFORTABLE WITH MOBILE BANKING","Providing advisory services and training increased women's comfort with mobile banking from 46% to 78%.","78%","INCREASE IN DAIRY INCOME POST-DIGITIZATION","Income increases after digitization of value chain payments.","// Pictures From Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping Report //","Reflection","This work reinforced a critical insight: technology alone does not drive inclusion. Sustainable impact emerges at the intersection of context, culture, trust, and human-centered design. Working across both urban and rural India highlighted the importance of designing for complexity rather than assuming uniform solutions.  One of the clearest learnings was that one size never fits all. The realities, incentives, and constraints faced by urban merchants in Jaipur differed fundamentally from those of rural dairy farmers in Odisha, requiring distinct approaches to adoption, onboarding, and value creation.  The research also underscored that gender and financial inclusion are deeply intersectional. Women’s access to and use of digital finance was shaped not only by gender, but by household power dynamics, social networks, literacy levels, and access to technology, making simplistic “women-focused” solutions insufficient.  Another key insight was the role of aspiration. Adoption of digital financial services was driven as much by identity and belonging as by functional utility. For many users, engaging with digital finance represented participation in a broader vision of a modern, forward-looking India.  Finally, the experience emphasized that evidence must guide investment decisions. For the development sector in particular, rigorous research linking digital financial services to measurable poverty reduction and resilience outcomes is essential to justify scale, funding, and policy prioritization.  Collectively, this experience shaped my approach to designing and leading work in complex, multi-stakeholder systems, where behavioral change, infrastructure, product design, and policy frameworks must align to create inclusive, scalable, and sustainable impact.","more projects","2014–2020","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Designing a Paperless-by-Default Government at Global Scale","2023","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Designing Sustainability into Everyday Retail at National Scale","2022","Mycelium Leather Go-to-Market Strategy - VTT","Taking a Deep-Tech Material from Lab Proof to Market-Ready Offering","Go to top","Email","hello@meettarek.com","Current Residence","Helsinki, Finland","Current time","4:22:12 PM","Socials","Linkedin","Twitter","Great ideas start with a hello.","made by Tarek Fahmy","@ All rights reserved","Site map","Home","Projects","About","Process","Testimonials","Selected Projects","AI & AUTOMATION","STRATEGY & INNOVATION","DIRECT SOCIAL IMPACT","EXPERIENCE DESIGN","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/projects/india-digital-financial-inclusion"},"/projects/sok-mara-sustainability-strategy":{"version":1,"title":"Tarek Fahmy","description":"Tarek Fahmy as a strategic consultant, transformation advisor, organizational designer and experience designer portfolio and case studies.","keywords":"","h1":[],"h2":["From Strategy to Measurable Change in Retail and Consumption","You might also like","Let's Talk About Your Vision"],"h3":["Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","From Ambitious Targets to Everyday Retail Reality","Translating Sustainability Ambition into Human-Centered Strategy","Embedding Sustainability into Retail Systems and Experiences"],"h4":["Designing Sustainability into Everyday Retail at National Scale","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Mycelium Leather Go-to-Market Strategy - VTT"],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["Close","2023","Services","Service Design, Sustainability Strategy Support, Research & Insights, Persona & Scenario Design, Systems Thinking, Stakeholder Alignment","Client","SOKOS Hotels / S Group (Finland)","Team","SOK Sustainability & Strategy Leadership, Miltton Sustainability Consultants, Retail Operations & Brand Stakeholders","Sustainable Retail Systems","Human-Centered Sustainability","Climate & Food Systems Transformation","Cooperative Business Model","Strategy-to-Experience Alignment","Overview","SOK Mara leads retail operations for S Group, Finland’s largest cooperative retailer, serving nearly 80% of Finnish households through brands such as Prisma, S-market, and Sale. In 2023, SOK updated its sustainability strategy to translate ambitious climate and responsibility commitments into concrete actions across stores, supply chains, and customer experiences.\n\nAs Lead Service Designer, I supported the strategy by grounding sustainability ambitions in real human behavior. My work focused on research, insights, personas, and scenarios connecting customer expectations, employee realities, and operational constraints so the final strategy could move beyond targets and reports into everyday decision-making at scale.","Context & Challenge","By 2023, S Group had already made bold sustainability commitments: carbon negativity by 2025, a 90% emissions reduction by 2030, and a fundamental shift toward sustainable food systems. The challenge was no longer ambition; it was execution across nearly 2,000 outlets, thousands of employees, and millions of customers with diverse needs and price sensitivities.\n\nRetail sustainability sits at the intersection of operations, customer choice, and supply chains. Energy crises, inflation, and evolving EU regulation (CSRD, ESRS) added pressure to ensure that sustainability decisions remained commercially viable, credible, and understandable to customers.\n\nThe strategy update needed to align climate goals, food systems, circular economy initiatives, and biodiversity into a coherent direction while making sustainability feel natural, affordable, and trustworthy in everyday shopping moments.","Design Approach","My role was to bring a service design lens into the sustainability strategy process. I led and supported qualitative research, synthesizing insights from customers, store-level realities, and internal stakeholders to understand expectations, tensions, and decision drivers around sustainable consumption.\n\nI developed personas and future-facing scenarios that reflected real customer mindsets from price-conscious families to sustainability-driven consumers and operational perspectives from retail staff. These artifacts helped align stakeholders on who the strategy was really for and how sustainability choices would play out in practice.\n\nThe insights and scenarios were then handed over to sustainability consultants to shape the strategic narrative. This ensured the final strategy was not only scientifically robust and policy-aligned, but also grounded in lived experience and behavioral realism.","Strategy Integration","The resulting strategy embedded sustainability directly into S Group’s retail operating model. Climate action focused on renewable energy leadership, energy efficiency, and value chain emissions reduction, while food systems strategy centered on nudging customers toward plant-based, affordable, and locally produced choices.\n\nRather than restricting choice, the strategy emphasized visibility, affordability, and convenience, making sustainable options easier to choose without moralizing or excluding customers. Loyalty data, in-store communication, pricing campaigns, and merchandising all became tools for behavior change.\n\nFrom a systems perspective, sustainability was aligned across governance, procurement standards, store design, and brand communication, allowing local cooperatives to adapt initiatives while maintaining a shared national direction.","Impact","The 2023 sustainability strategy supported S Group in achieving and accelerating several targets ahead of schedule, while strengthening customer trust and brand leadership in responsible retail. Sustainability became a core driver of operational decisions, customer experience design, and long-term value creation.\n\nBy grounding the strategy in human-centered insights, SOK Mara ensured sustainability was not treated as a reporting exercise, but as a lived part of everyday retail, from energy use and packaging to food choices and loyalty engagement.","90%","Emissions Reduction Achieved Early","Reduction target five years ahead of schedule through renewable energy, efficiency upgrades, and systemic operational change.","60%","Plant-Based Food Sales","Of total food sales by 2024","31%","Food Waste Reduction","Compared to the 2014 baseline, supported by real-time tracking and dynamic pricing models.","49,000 kg","Packaging Material Avoided Annually","Packaging redesign initiatives saved approximately 47,000 kg of glass and 2,000 kg of aluminum per year.","// Pictures are representing some of the executed concepts in the strategy //","Reflection","This project reinforced my belief that sustainability only scales when it is designed around real human behavior. Working with SOK Mara showed how powerful service design can be in bridging climate science, business strategy, and everyday choices—especially in environments as complex and visible as national retail.  As Lead Service Designer, my contribution was not to write the strategy, but to make it believable and usable: aligning expectations through research, personas, and scenarios, and ensuring sustainability narratives reflected real life. This experience continues to shape how I approach sustainability, strategy, and systems design focusing on frictionless adoption, trust, and long-term impact rather than ambition alone.","more projects","2019","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Mapping India's Digital Financial Inclusion Journey and Driving Last-Mile Adoption","2014–2020","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Designing a Paperless-by-Default Government at Global Scale","2022","Mycelium Leather Go-to-Market Strategy - VTT","Taking a Deep-Tech Material from Lab Proof to Market-Ready Offering","Go to top","Email","hello@meettarek.com","Current Residence","Helsinki, Finland","Current time","4:22:12 PM","Socials","Linkedin","Twitter","Great ideas start with a hello.","made by Tarek Fahmy","@ All rights reserved","Site map","Home","Projects","About","Process","Testimonials","Selected Projects","AI & AUTOMATION","STRATEGY & INNOVATION","DIRECT SOCIAL IMPACT","EXPERIENCE DESIGN","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/projects/sok-mara-sustainability-strategy"},"/projects/usaid-asist-digital-records":{"version":1,"title":"Tarek Fahmy","description":"Tarek Fahmy as a strategic consultant, transformation advisor, organizational designer and experience designer portfolio and case studies.","keywords":"","h1":[],"h2":["Paper Reduction, Audit Readiness, and Digital Governance at Scale","You might also like","Let's Talk About Your Vision"],"h3":["Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","From Fragmented Paper Files to a Single Digital Source of Truth","Turning Policy and Compliance into Usable, Human-Centered Systems","Landing a Digital-First Operating Model Across 100+ Missions"],"h4":["Designing a Paperless-by-Default Government at Global Scale","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Mycelium Leather Go-to-Market Strategy - VTT"],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["Close","2014–2020","Services","Service Design, Digital Transformation, Change Management, Training & Enablement, Information Governance, Process Design","Client","USAID (United States Agency for International Development)","Team","USAID Office of Acquisition & Assistance, Records Management Leadership, Global Mission AORs/CORs, IT and Policy Stakeholders","Digital Records Transformation","Global Compliance at Scale","Human-Centered Governance","Paperless Operations","Federal Digital Mandates","Overview","ASIST (Agency Secure Image and Storage Tracking) is USAID’s official electronic records system for managing AOR and COR award files across missions worldwide. Mandated as the sole system of record, ASIST marked a fundamental shift from fragmented, paper-heavy practices to standardized, digital-first recordkeeping aligned with federal records law.\n\nI worked as an Innovation Expert and Digital Transformation Lead, shaping the service, processes, and adoption model that enabled more than 100 missions to move away from paper while remaining audit-ready, compliant, and operationally efficient. The work balanced strict federal governance with the realities of day-to-day work in diverse global contexts.","Context & Challenge","Before ASIST, USAID’s AOR/COR records were managed through a patchwork of local paper files, shared drives, and informal practices. Documents were stored in filing cabinets across missions, making retrieval slow, audits resource-intensive, and compliance inconsistent. Hybrid paper-digital files were common, increasing risk and rework.\n\nAt the same time, federal pressure was increasing. Records legislation and government-wide “digital by default” mandates required agencies to manage official records electronically, end hybrid filing, and improve auditability. For USAID, operating in more than 80 countries, this was not just a technology challenge—it was an operating model and behavior change challenge.\n\nASIST was positioned as the official, mandatory repository for AOR/COR records. Only documents filed in ASIST would be treated as the official record, forcing a decisive move away from paper and informal storage toward standardized, agency-wide practices.","Design Approach","My role focused on translating complex federal records requirements into workflows that AORs and CORs could realistically follow. I led and co-led discovery with missions to understand how paper files were actually created, maintained, and used, and where compliance and usability broke down.\n\nUsing service design methods, I helped shape end-to-end workflows for award file creation, maintenance, and close-out. This included defining standardized folder structures, metadata, and naming conventions, and clear user journeys that aligned with real work rather than abstract policy.\n\nEqually important was enablement. I co-created training materials, coaching approaches, and practical guidance that made ASIST usable, not just mandatory. The goal was behavior change at scale: helping people understand not only what to do, but why it mattered for audits, continuity, and decision-making.","Implementation at Scale","ASIST was rolled out globally with automated folder creation, and notifications triggered when AORs and CORs were designated in USAID’s procurement system. This reduced manual setup and reinforced consistent practices from day one.\n\nAs the system became embedded, day-to-day work changed. Records could be accessed securely from anywhere, audits could be conducted remotely, and central oversight teams no longer depended on physical file retrieval. Paper storage rooms and ad-hoc filing practices gradually disappeared.\n\nCrucially, ASIST was not implemented as a standalone IT system. It was integrated into governance, training requirements, and authorization to perform award administration, making digital recordkeeping part of how work was done, not an optional add-on.","Impact","The ASIST transformation contributed to USAID’s shift toward a majority-digital records profile, with roughly two-thirds of agency records fully digital by 2022. Missions reduced reliance on physical storage, improved document retrieval times, and strengthened audit readiness across portfolios.\n\nBy standardizing workflows and enforcing a single system of record, USAID reduced compliance risk, improved consistency in AOR/COR files, and aligned operations with federal electronic records mandates—while freeing up physical space and staff time previously tied to paper.","~65%","Digital Records Adoption","By 2022, approximately two-thirds of USAID records were fully digital, reflecting a decisive shift away from paper-based filing.","100+","Global Missions Enabled","ASIST supported standardized, compliant recordkeeping across more than 100 missions worldwide.","40%","Time Returned to Core Work","By eliminating manual file searches and physical retrieval.","$5M","Paper & Storage Cost Avoidance","By moving award files to a digital-only model, USAID avoided millions of dollars cost wise.","// Pictures are for two different award days, USAID global hierarchy chart. //","Reflection","This project was as much about people and culture as it was about systems and policy. I worked across multiple countries and missions, meeting teams where paper-based workarounds had evolved out of necessity, not resistance. Every location had its own constraints connectivity, staffing models, risk tolerance, local habits and ASIST only worked when those realities were acknowledged and designed for.  I spent significant time traveling, listening, running trainings, adjusting workflows, and co-creating practical tweaks that respected both federal compliance and human behavior. That meant aligning legal requirements, technology limitations, and cultural differences often mediating between policy owners, IT teams, auditors, and frontline staff. Designing compliance, in this context, meant making the right thing also the easy thing.  Seeing missions successfully adopt a digital-first way of working and ultimately being recognized with an award for the impact of this work made the complexity worthwhile. It reinforced my belief that large-scale digital transformation succeeds when service design bridges governance, trust, and real work on the ground.","more projects","2019","Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Mapping India's Digital Financial Inclusion Journey and Driving Last-Mile Adoption","2023","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Designing Sustainability into Everyday Retail at National Scale","2022","Mycelium Leather Go-to-Market Strategy - VTT","Taking a Deep-Tech Material from Lab Proof to Market-Ready Offering","Go to top","Email","hello@meettarek.com","Current Residence","Helsinki, Finland","Current time","4:22:12 PM","Socials","Linkedin","Twitter","Great ideas start with a hello.","made by Tarek Fahmy","@ All rights reserved","Site map","Home","Projects","About","Process","Testimonials","Selected Projects","AI & AUTOMATION","STRATEGY & INNOVATION","DIRECT SOCIAL IMPACT","EXPERIENCE DESIGN","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/projects/usaid-asist-digital-records"},"/projects":{"version":1,"title":"Tarek Fahmy","description":"Tarek Fahmy as a strategic consultant, transformation advisor, organizational designer and experience designer portfolio and case studies.","keywords":"","h1":[],"h2":["Selected Projects","Wall Of Honor","Any Questions?","Let's Talk About Your Vision"],"h3":["Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Mycelium Leather Go-to-Market Strategy - VTT","Designing the Witness Experience in the Finnish Courts","Vultures Mapping Illegal Dumps in Lima","Reimagining Digital Future","Improving City Services for Helsinki’s Diverse Communities","Transforming TB Detection Through Bio Detection Innovation","Advancing Circular Economy Business Models (Open Innovation Camp)"],"h4":["Digital Financial Inclusion Journey Mapping - India","Paperless Records & Global Compliance Transformation","Sustainability Communication Strategy, Sokos Hotels","Mycelium Leather Go-to-Market Strategy - VTT","Designing the Witness Experience in the Finnish Courts","Vultures Mapping Illegal Dumps in Lima","Reimagining Digital Future","Improving City Services for Helsinki’s Diverse Communities","Transforming TB Detection Through Bio Detection Innovation","Advancing Circular Economy Business Models (Open Innovation Camp)","\"Tarek is one of the most creative and inspiring professionals I’ve met.
